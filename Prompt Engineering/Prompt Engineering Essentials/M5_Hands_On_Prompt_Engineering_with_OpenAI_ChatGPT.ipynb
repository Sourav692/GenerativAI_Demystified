The Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting pattern is a technique used to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models by encouraging them to think step-by-step through a problem.

       "### Explanation:\n",
       "1. **API Key**: Replace `'your-api-key-here'` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n",
       "2. **Prompt Generation**: The `generate_chain_of_thought_prompt` function creates a structured prompt that encourages the model to think step-by-step.\n",
       "3. **API Call**: The `get_answer` function sends the prompt to the OpenAI API and retrieves the model's response.\n",
       "4. **Example Usage**: The script includes an example question about the capital of France, but you can replace it with any question you want.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Note:\n",
       "- Adjust the `max_tokens` parameter based on how long you expect the answer to be.\n",
       "- The `temperature` parameter controls the randomness of the output; a value of `0.0` makes the output more deterministic.\n",
