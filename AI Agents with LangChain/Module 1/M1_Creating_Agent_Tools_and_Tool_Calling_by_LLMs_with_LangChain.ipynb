            "Summary: Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology conglomerate headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Founded in 1975, the company became influential in the rise of personal computers through software like Windows, and the company has since expanded to Internet services, cloud computing, video gaming and other fields. Microsoft is the largest software maker, one of the most valuable public U.S. companies, and one of the most valuable brands globally.\n",
            "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. During the 41 years from 1980 to 2021 Microsoft released 9 versions of MS-DOS with a median frequency of 2 years, and 13 versions of Windows with a median frequency of 3 years. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market. Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000.  He oversaw the then-largest of Microsoft's corporate acquisitions in Skype Technologies in 2011, and an increased focus on hardware that led to its first in-house PC line, the Surface, in 2012, and the formation of Microsoft Mobile through Nokia. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has changed focus towards cloud computing, as well as its large acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016. Under Nadella's direction, the company has also expanded its video gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022 and acquiring Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in 2023.\n",
            "Microsoft has been market-dominant in the IBM PC–compatible operating system market and the office software suite market since the 1990s. Its best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems and the Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, which most notably include the Word word processor, Excel spreadsheet editor, and the PowerPoint presentation program. Its flagship hardware products are the Surface lineup of personal computers and Xbox video game consoles, the latter of which includes the Xbox network; the company also provides a range of consumer Internet services such as Bing web search, the MSN web portal, the Outlook.com (Hotmail) email service and the Microsoft Store. In the enterprise and development fields, Microsoft most notably provides the Azure cloud computing platform, Microsoft SQL Server database software, and Visual Studio.\n",
            "Microsoft is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Meta. In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion. It has been criticized for its monopolistic practices, and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.\n",

            "Summary: Microsoft Office, MS Office, or simply Office, is an office suite and family of client software, server software, and services developed by Microsoft. The first version of the Office suite, announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX, contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint — all three of which remain core products in Office — and over time Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, Object Linking and Embedding data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand.\n",
            "The suite currently includes a word processor (Word), a spreadsheet program (Excel), a presentation program (PowerPoint), a notetaking program (OneNote), an email client (Outlook) and a file-hosting service client (OneDrive). The Windows version includes a database management system (Access). Office is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the desktop version, available for PCs running the Windows and macOS operating systems, and sold at retail or under volume licensing. Microsoft also maintains mobile apps for Android and iOS, as well as Office on the web, a version of the software that runs within a web browser, which are offered freely.\n",
            "Since Office 2013, Microsoft has promoted Office 365 as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the use of the software and other services on a subscription business model, and users receive feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and cloud computing integration that are not necessarily included in the \"on-premises\" releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales. Microsoft also rebranded most of their standard Office 365 editions as \"Microsoft 365\" to reflect their inclusion of features and services beyond the core Microsoft Office suite. Although Microsoft announced that it was to phase out the Microsoft Office brand in favor of Microsoft 365 by 2023, with the name continuing only for legacy product offerings, later that year it reversed this decision and announced Office 2024, which they released in September 2024.\n",

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\n",
            "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\n",
            "Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\n",
            "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, while raising ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n",

            "Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\n",
            "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\n",
            "Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\n",
            "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, while raising ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n",

However, one question that often comes up is, can these AI models learn themselves just like humans do? As per the recent developments – **They can**. To understand this in a better way, let’s go back to our college days when C++, Java, and Python were the primary languages we needed to master to excel in computer science. Learning these languages requires understanding syntax, semantics, practical application, and problem-solving. So, to get a strong hold on these languages, we practised continuously (or you can say get trained). Also, we learned a lot from our classmates and professors. Right? Similarly, just like humans can learn from their own thinking, expertise and other mediums, perhaps LLMs can, too.\\n\\nHowever, gaining expertise or becoming a subject matter expert is quite a rigorous journey for both humans and LLMs. We know about the human learning process and reasoning capabilities for making decisions and completing tasks, but what does LLM training look like?\\n\\nCan I say?\\n\\n1. **Firstly, pre-training of LLM:** In this step, you help the model learn patterns, such as grammar, sentence structure, and even relationships between words and concepts.\\n2. **Instruction-tuning (or Fine-Tuning):** To fine-tune the model, a curated dataset containing examples of instructions and desired responses is used.\\n3. **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF):** Human evaluators rank model responses, which is used further to improve the model’s alignment with user expectations.\\n\\nThat makes sense, right? But what if we build an agentic workflow to make the model learn and give the output while doing all the checks independently? It would be like having your own assistant who can do all the work without any human intervention. Further, in this article we will talk about the 4 Agentic AI Design Patterns for Architecting AI Systems.\\n\\n* *[**What is Agentic AI Reflection Pattern?**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/10/agentic-ai-reflection-pattern/)*\\n* *[**What is Agentic AI Tool Use Pattern?**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/10/agentic-ai-tool-use-pattern/)*\\n* *[**What is Agentic AI Planning Pattern?**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/11/agentic-ai-planning-pattern/)*\\n* [**What is Agentic AI Multi-Agent Pattern?**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/11/agentic-ai-multi-agent-pattern/)\\n\\n![Agentic AI design pattern](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Artboard-1-copy-4.webp)\\n\\nSource: Author\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\n* The article discusses how AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) like [**GPT**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/05/applications-of-gpt-4o/), can learn autonomously by adopting agentic workflows, which mimic human-like iterative problem-solving.\\n* Agentic workflows enhance AI performance by refining tasks step-by-step, similar to how humans review and improve their work repeatedly for better results.\\n* Four key Agentic Design Patterns—Reflection, Tool Use, Planning, and Multi-Agent Collaboration—are introduced as strategies that make AI systems more autonomous and capable.\\n\\n## Table of contents\\n\\n* [Overview](#h-overview)\\n* [What is Agentic Design Patterns?](#h-what-is-agentic-design-patterns)\\n* [Agentic Design Patterns: Evaluations](#h-agentic-design-patterns-evaluations)\\n* [4 Types of Agentic Design Patterns that You Must Know](#h-4-types-of-agentic-design-patterns-that-you-must-know)\\n  + [Reflection Pattern](#h-1-reflection-pattern)\\n  + [Tool Use Pattern](#h-2-tool-use-pattern)\\n  + [Planning Pattern](#h-3-planning-pattern)\\n  + [Multi-Agent Pattern](#h-4-multi-agent-pattern)\\n* [Conclusion](#h-conclusion)\\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](#h-frequently-asked-questions)\\n\\n## What is Agentic Design Patterns?\\n\\nThe agentic design pattern is introduced as a solution for making LLMs more autonomous. Instead of just giving the model one prompt and expecting a final answer (like writing an essay in one go), an agent-like approach involves prompting the LLM multiple times, step by step. Each step refines the task, with the model improving its output iteratively.\\n\\nTo understand this better, let’s look at it like this:\\n\\nWhen we prompt an LLM in zero-shot mode, it’s like asking someone to write a story in one go without revising. LLMs do well at this, but they can do even better. By using an agent-like workflow, we can prompt the LLM multiple times in steps. Each step builds on the previous one, refining the response. Think of it like asking the LLM to go over the essay multiple times, improving it with each pass.\\n\\nBy each step, I meant:\\n\\nLet’s take the example of writing a code using Agentic workflow:\\n\\n1. **Plan an outline for the code:** Break down the task into smaller modules or functions.\\n2. **Gather information and content:** Research libraries, algorithms, or existing solutions. Do web searches or check the documentation if needed.\\n3. **Write the first draft of the code:** Implement the basic functionality, focusing on structure over perfection.\\n4. **Review the code for inefficiencies or errors:** Check for unnecessary code, bugs, or logic flaws.\\n5. **Revise the code:** Refactor, optimise, or add comments for clarity.\\n\\nRinse and repeat until the code is efficient and clean.\\n\\nBy allowing the model to work through these steps independently, the agentic design pattern enhances both human-like reasoning and efficiency. This is similar to how humans break down complex tasks, gather information, make improvements, and iterate until the final result is satisfactory. Now, let us understand the Agentic design pattern in detail.\\n\\n## Agentic Design Patterns: Evaluations\\n\\n![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/unnamed-68.webp)\\n\\nSource:\\xa0 Andrew Ng | [Deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io)\\n\\nAndrew Ng’s analysis, shared in a letter on\\xa0[**Deeplearning.ai**](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io), noted advancements in AI-driven code generation, particularly focusing on the performance of models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The evaluation was centred on these models’ capabilities to perform on the widely recognized HumanEval coding benchmark, a common standard for assessing an algorithm’s proficiency in writing code.\\n\\nThe data presented shows the evolution in AI coding abilities using AI agents. [**GPT-3.5**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/08/generative-ais-shift-from-gpt-3-5-to-gpt-4-journey/), when tested in a zero-shot setting (i.e., without any prior examples), achieved a correctness rate of 48.1%. [**GPT-4**](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/), also evaluated in a zero-shot manner, demonstrated a significant improvement, with a 67.0% success rate. However, what stood out in the analysis was how integrating these models into an iterative agent workflow (Agentic workflow) drastically boosted their performance. When [**GPT-3.5**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) was wrapped in such an agent loop, its accuracy soared to an impressive 95.1%, far surpassing its baseline and even approaching human-level coding proficiency.\\n\\nThis finding underscores the transformative potential of iterative workflows (Agentic workflow) in enhancing [**AI model**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/08/github-models/) performance, suggesting that the future of AI-assisted coding may heavily rely on these more advanced, adaptive frameworks rather than on model size or architecture improvements alone.\\n\\nBut what are Agentic design patterns that complete the delegation of autonomy to AI systems, enabling them to act more independently and effectively? These patterns structure AI agents to perform tasks, make decisions, and communicate with other systems in a more human-like and autonomous manner, ultimately creating both savvy and dependable applications.\\x7f\\n\\n## 4 Types of Agentic Design Patterns that You Must Know\\n\\nIn Agentic AI and the key design patterns, it’s essential to understand how each pattern empowers large language models (LLMs) like GPT to behave more autonomously and effectively. These design patterns push the boundaries of what AI can do by encouraging self-evaluation, tool integration, strategic thinking, and collaboration. Let’s explore four vital agentic design patterns that shape how these models operate and perform complex tasks.\\n\\nHere are the types of agentic design patterns:\\n\\n### 1. Reflection Pattern\\n\\n![Agentic Design Patterns  - Relection Pattern](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Artboard-1-1.webp)\\n\\nSource: Author\\n\\nThe [**Reflection Pattern**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/10/agentic-ai-reflection-pattern/) focuses on improving AI’s ability to evaluate and refine its own outputs. Imagine an LLM reviewing its generated content or code as if it were a human reviewer, identifying errors, gaps, or areas that need improvement and then offering suggestions for how to improve.\\n\\nThis self-critique loop is not limited to a single iteration. The AI can repeat the reflection process as many times as necessary to achieve a refined, polished result. For example, if tasked with writing software, the LLM can generate an initial version, critique its own logic and structure, and revise the code. The iterative nature of reflection leads to stronger, more reliable outputs over time.\\n\\nThis pattern is particularly useful in tasks that require precision, such as content creation, problem-solving, or code generation. Employing this approach can enhance the model’s accuracy and reliability through self-guided corrections.\\n\\nOne interesting example is Self-Reflective RAG. [**SELF-RAG**](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rag/langgraph_self_rag/) is a framework designed to improve language models’ quality and factual accuracy by integrating retrieval and self-reflection into the text generation process. Traditional [**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/09/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-in-ai/) models enhance responses by incorporating relevant retrieved passages but often retrieve a fixed number of documents regardless of their relevance, which can introduce noise or irrelevant content. SELF-RAG addresses these limitations through an adaptive approach that retrieves information on demand and uses reflection tokens to assess the generation’s quality.\\n\\n#### How SELF-RAG Uses Reflection?\\n\\nSELF-RAG incorporates self-reflection mechanisms via “reflection tokens,” which serve to evaluate various aspects of the text generation, such as relevance, support, and overall utility. During the generation process, the model evaluates whether retrieval is necessary and assesses the quality of the generated content by critiquing itself at different stages.\\n\\nHere’s the diagram for better understanding:\\n\\n![SELF-RAG Uses Reflection](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/unnamed-69-1.webp)\\n\\n**Source: [SELF-RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11511)**\\n\\n* **Traditional RAG** retrieves a fixed number of documents first, while **Self-RAG** performs retrieval dynamically based on the content being generated.\\n* **Self-RAG** evaluates multiple generated segments, critiques their quality, and selectively combines the most accurate information.\\n* **Self-RAG’s iterative process** enables refining the generation step by step, improving the accuracy and relevance of the output.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, Self-RAG adds an extra layer of self-reflection and refinement, leading to more reliable and precise answers.\\n\\n### 2. Tool Use Pattern\\n\\n![Toll Use Pattern](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Artboard-1-copy.webp)\\n\\n**Source: Author**\\n\\nThe Tool Use Pattern significantly broadens an LLM’s capability by allowing it to interact with external tools and resources to enhance its problem-solving abilities. Instead of relying solely on internal computations or knowledge, an AI following this pattern can access databases, search the web, or even execute complex functions via programming languages like Python.\\n\\nFor instance, an [**LLM**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/07/how-to-fine-tune-large-language-models-with-monsterapi/) could be prompted to retrieve data from the web for a specific query, analyze it, and integrate it into its output. Alternatively, it might be tasked with calculating statistical results, generating images, or manipulating spreadsheets—actions that go beyond simple text generation. By incorporating the use of tools, LLMs evolve from static knowledge banks into dynamic agents capable of interacting with external systems to achieve goals.\\n\\nThis pattern is powerful because it allows [**AI systems**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/07/google-unveils-ai-chips-on-device-machine-learning/) to tackle more complex, multifaceted tasks where internal knowledge alone isn’t sufficient, expanding their utility into real-world applications.\\n\\n### 3. Planning Pattern\\n\\n![Planning Pattern](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Artboard-1-copy-5.webp)\\n\\n**Source: Author**\\n\\nThe Planning Pattern enables an LLM to break down large, complicated tasks into smaller, more manageable components. Planning equips an agent with the ability to react to requests and strategically structure the steps needed to achieve a goal.\\n\\nInstead of tackling a problem linearly, ad hocly, an LLM using the Planning Pattern will create a roadmap of subtasks, determining the most efficient path to completion. For example, when coding, the LLM would first outline the overall structure before implementing individual functions. This avoids confusion or meandering logic and keeps the AI focused on the main objective.\\n\\n**[ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)](https://research.google/blog/react-synergizing-reasoning-and-acting-in-language-models/)** and [**ReWOO (Reasoning With Open Ontology)**](https://billxbf.github.io/works/ReWOO_preprint.pdf) further extend this approach by integrating decision-making and contextual reasoning into the planning process. ReAct enables the LLM to dynamically alternate between reasoning (thinking through the problem) and acting (performing specific tasks), allowing for more adaptive and flexible planning. By combining these two steps, the LLM can refine its approach iteratively, addressing unexpected challenges as they arise.\\n\\nReWOO, on the other hand, enhances the planning pattern by using an open-world ontology to guide reasoning. This means the LLM can incorporate broader contextual information and knowledge from various domains, leading to more informed decision-making. With ReWOO, the AI can adjust the plan in real-time based on newly acquired information or changing requirements, ensuring a more robust and comprehensive problem-solving approach.\\n\\nTogether, the Planning Pattern, ReAct, and ReWOO enable an LLM to handle complex tasks in a structured yet adaptive manner, resulting in efficient and goal-oriented execution.\\n\\nMoreover, generating a structured plan (or a “user\\\\_request\\\\_summary”) ensures that the AI keeps track of all steps and doesn’t lose sight of the broader task. This method ensures higher quality and consistency in the results, especially in complex problem-solving or multi-phase projects.\\n\\n### 4. Multi-Agent Pattern\\n\\n![MultiAgent Pattern](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Artboard-1-copy-3.webp)\\n\\n**Source: Author**\\n\\nThe Multi-Agent Pattern builds upon the concept of delegation, akin to project management in human teams. This pattern involves assigning different agents (which are instances of an LLM with specific roles or functions) to handle various subtasks. These agents can work independently on their assignments while also communicating and collaborating to achieve a unified outcome.\\n\\nThere are several types of multi-agent patterns:\\n\\n1. **Collaborative Agents**: Multiple agents work together on different parts of a task, sharing progress and building toward a unified result. Each agent may specialize in a different domain.\\n2. **Supervised Agents**: A central supervisor agent manages other agents, coordinating their activities and verifying results to ensure quality.\\n3. **Hierarchical Teams**: A structured system where higher-level agents oversee lower-level agents, with decision-making cascaded through levels to accomplish complex tasks.\\n\\n***For more details on this, explore: [Multi-agent Collaboration](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/multi-agent-collaboration/).***\\n\\nFor instance, in a scenario requiring both text analysis and numerical computation, two separate agents can handle each task, sharing their results to form a comprehensive solution. One agent might focus on understanding the context, while another processes data, and together they deliver a holistic response. This pattern is particularly powerful for tackling large-scale or complex problems that require diverse skill sets.\\n\\nIn short, the Multiagent Pattern mirrors how humans collaborate across specialities, ensuring that each agent focuses on its strengths while contributing to a greater, coordinated effort.\\n\\nBy mastering these four agentic design patterns, developers and users alike can unlock the full potential of AI systems. The Reflection Pattern improves accuracy and quality through self-evaluation, Tool Use enables dynamic, real-world interactions, Planning provides a roadmap for solving complex tasks, and Multiagent Collaboration ensures that multiple agents work together effectively. Together, these patterns create a foundation for building more intelligent, autonomous AI systems capable of addressing real-world challenges.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAgentic Design Patterns emphasize the transformative potential of agentic workflows in making AI models, particularly [**large language models (LLMs)**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/08/hallucination-in-llms/), more autonomous and efficient. It explains that while models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 perform well in zero-shot tasks, their accuracy and effectiveness significantly improve when adopting an iterative, agentic workflow. This method allows the model to break down tasks, self-evaluate, leverage external tools, plan strategically, and collaborate with other agents, enhancing their problem-solving capabilities.\\n\\nThe article introduces four key design patterns—Reflection, Tool Use, Planning, and Multiagent—that form the foundation of these agentic workflows. These patterns push the boundaries of what AI can do and enable AI systems to behave more independently and intelligently, much like humans handling complex tasks. This signals that future AI advancements will depend on increasing model size and developing more adaptive and strategic workflows.\\n\\nIn this series on Agentic Design Patterns, we will further explore each design pattern in detail: Reflection, Tool Use, Planning, and Multiagent, uncovering how they empower AI systems to become even more autonomous and capable.\\n\\nStay tuned!!!!\\n\\n***Explore the [The Agentic AI Pioneer Program](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/agenticaipioneer/?utm_source=blog_page&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=seo) to deepen your understanding of Agent AI and unlock its full potential.

2025\\n\\n--\\n\\n3\\n\\nListen\\n\\nShare\\n\\n# 1. Introduction to Agentic AI\\n\\nAgentic AI refers to AI systems that can act on their own, making decisions and performing tasks with little human help. Think of it like a smart assistant that can plan a trip, book flights, and adjust plans based on real-time updates, all by itself. As of April 2025, it’s becoming more common in areas like customer service, where chatbots handle queries, and supply chain management, where it optimizes logistics.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\n## 1.1 Key Points\\n\\n* Agentic AI involves autonomous AI systems that make decisions with minimal human input, transforming industries like customer service and supply chain management.\\n* It seems likely that frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and AutoGen are key tools for building these systems, supporting single-agent and multi-agent setups.\\n* The evidence leans toward Agentic AI enhancing productivity, but challenges like coordination in multi-agent systems and potential biases are debated.\\n* An unexpected detail is the integration of real-time data handling, enhancing decision-making in dynamic environments like financial trading.\\n* Research suggests Agentic AI design patterns help build autonomous AI systems for complex tasks, with five key patterns: Reflection, Tool Use, ReAct, Planning, and Multi-Agent Collaboration.\\n* It seems likely that frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen support these patterns, with LangChain for Reflection, Tool Use, and ReAct, and AutoGen for Planning and Multi-Agent Collaboration.\\n* The evidence leans toward these patterns improving AI performance, but challenges like coordination in multi-agent systems are debated.\\n* An unexpected detail is how the ReAct Pattern enhances interpretability by generating human-like task-solving trajectories, improving trust in AI systems.\\n\\n## 1.2 Tools and Frameworks\\n\\nTo build these systems, developers use frameworks like:\\n\\n* **LangChain**: Great for creating chatbots that can use tools like web searches.\\n* **LlamaIndex**: Helps connect AI to company data for smarter decisions.\\n* **AutoGen**: Allows multiple AI agents to work together, like a team solving complex problems.\\n\\n## 1.3 Single vs Multi-Agent Systems\\n\\n* **Single Agent**: One AI does everything, like a chatbot answering questions. It’s simpler but may struggle with complex tasks.\\n* **Multi-Agent**: Multiple AIs work together, like a team where one handles logistics and another customer service. It’s more robust but harder to coordinate.\\n\\n## 1.4 Design Patterns in Multi-Agent Systems\\n\\nFor multi-agent setups, there are patterns like:\\n\\n* **Parallel**: Agents work on different parts at the same time, like processing text and images together.\\n* **Sequential**: Agents take turns, like cleaning data then analyzing it.\\n* **Loop**: An agent repeats a task until done, like refining a solution.\\n* **Router**: One agent directs tasks to others, like routing customer queries.\\n* **Aggregator**: Collects and combines results from multiple agents, like merging search results.\\n* **Network**: Agents are connected like a web, sharing information.\\n* **Hierarchical**: Agents have levels, like executives giving goals to managers.\\n\\nThese patterns help structure how agents work together, and examples show how to implement them using AutoGen and other tools.\\n\\n# Detailed Analysis / Description of Agentic AI Systems\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nThis section provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic AI, covering all aspects requested in the query, including fundamentals, components, single vs. multi-agent architectures, and design patterns. The analysis is grounded in recent research and practical implementations, reflecting the state of the field as of April 8, 2025.\\n\\n# Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Agentic Architectures\\n\\nAgentic AI, as defined in recent studies, involves AI systems that act autonomously, adapting in real-time to solve multi-step problems with minimal human supervision. For instance, [Agentic AI Architecture: A Deep Dive](https://markovate.com/blog/agentic-ai-architecture/) highlights its potential to transform human-machine collaboration, with examples like AI-powered travel planners and supply-chain optimizers. The architecture of these systems is layered, often including input layers for data collection, agent orchestration for task management, and specialized agents for planning, execution, and self-improvement, as noted in [Agentic AI Architecture: The Blueprint for Next-Gen AI Solutions](https://www.q3tech.com/blogs/agentic-ai-architecture/).\\n\\n**Key frameworks include:**\\n\\n* **LangChain**: Launched in October 2022, it facilitates LLM integration with tools, supporting applications like chatbots and document analysis, as per [LangChain — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LangChain). It’s noted for its modular workflow and prompt management, with over 1 million developers using it, according to [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/).\\n* **LlamaIndex**: An open-source framework for building LLM-powered agents over enterprise data, it supports over 160 data formats and is praised for its RAG capabilities, as seen in [LlamaIndex — Build Knowledge Assistants over your Enterprise Data](https://www.llamaindex.ai/). It’s particularly valued for its flexibility in data integration, with over 300 integration packages available, per [GitHub — run-llama/llama\\\\_index](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index).\\n* **AutoGen**: Developed by Microsoft, it focuses on multi-agent workflows, offering a layered design with Core API for message passing and AgentChat API for rapid prototyping, as detailed in [GitHub — microsoft/autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen). It’s noted for its ability to handle complex conversations, with examples like group chats for task solving, per [Examples | AutoGen 0.2](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/Examples/).\\n\\nThese frameworks enable developers to build agentic systems by providing abstractions for perception, decision-making, and action, with tools like vector stores (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma) and LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, LLaMA), as seen in [Langflow | Low-code AI builder for agentic and RAG applications](https://langflow.org/).\\n\\n# Chapter 2: Components of AI Agents\\n\\nAI agents comprise several components, each critical for autonomy:\\n\\n## **2.1 Perception**:\\n\\nInvolves sensing the environment, often through natural language processing or data ingestion. For example, LlamaIndex uses data loaders to ingest data from APIs, PDFs, and SQL databases, as per [Framework — LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/framework/). Sample code:\\n\\n## Sample code with LangChain:\\n\\n```\\nfrom langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun\\nsearch = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()\\nresult = search.run(\"What is the weather like today?\")\\n```\\n\\n## Sample code with LlamaIndex:\\n\\n```\\nfrom llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader\\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\\'data\\').load_data()\\n```\\n\\n## 2.2 **Decision-Making**:\\n\\nUses LLMs as reasoning engines to plan actions. LangChain’s agents decide which tools to use based on descriptions, as shown in [Agents | 🦜️🔗 LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/). AutoGen agents reason through conversations, per [Building AI Agents with AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/Agentic-Workflows/).\\n\\n## **2.3 Action**:\\n\\nExecuting decisions, such as calling APIs or generating code. Tools in LangChain include serpapi for web search, while AutoGen supports code execution in Docker containers, as noted in [AutoGen — AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Concepts/Execution/). Sample code:\\n\\n**Sample Code**\\n\\n```\\nfrom langchain.tools import AIPluginTool\\nemail_tool = AIPluginTool.from_plugin_url(\"[invalid url, do not cite]\")\\ntools = [email_tool]\\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=\"zero-shot-react-description\", verbose=True)\\nagent.run(\"Send an email to john@example.com with the subject \\'Hello\\' and body \\'How are you?\\'\")\\n```\\n\\n## 2.4 **Memory**:\\n\\nEssential for maintaining context. LangChain offers ConversationBufferMemory, and LlamaIndex uses vector stores for long-term memory, as per [A Guide to Agentic AI Architecture | by DataStax](/building-the-open-data-stack/a-guide-to-agentic-ai-architecture-c665f2ba30c2). **Sample code with LangChain:**\\n\\n```\\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\\nmemory = ConversationBufferMemory()\\n```\\n\\n## **2.5 Communication**:\\n\\nInvolves interacting with other agents or humans. AutoGen’s group chats facilitate this, while LangChain supports agent-to-agent tool calls, per [Build an Agent | 🦜️🔗 LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/agent_custom_llm/). Sample code:\\n\\n**Sample code with AutoGen**\\n\\n```\\ngroupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, assistant], messages=[], max_round=5)\\n```\\n\\n# Chapter 3: Single Agent vs Multi-Agent Architectures\\n\\n* **Single Agent Architectures**: Involve one agent performing tasks independently, suitable for simpler tasks like customer support chatbots. LangChain is primarily designed for this, with examples like a weather query agent, as seen in [Beginner’s Guide to Creating AI Agents With LangChain | by Vijaykumar Kartha](/%40vijaykumarkartha/beginners-guide-to-creating-ai-agents-with-langchain-7b8f9d2e0a7c). Advantages include simplicity and lower overhead, but challenges include limited capabilities for complex tasks, per [Building Smart AI Agents with LangChain: A Practical Guide](/%40data_science_guy/building-smart-ai-agents-with-langchain-a-practical-guide-1234567890).\\n* **Multi-Agent Architectures**: Involve multiple agents collaborating, ideal for complex workflows. AutoGen excels here, with examples like group chats for data visualization, as per [Examples | AutoGen 0.2](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/Examples/). Advantages include diversity and robustness, but challenges include coordination complexity, noted in [AI Agentic Design Patterns with AutoGen — DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-agentic-design-patterns-with-autogen/). LlamaIndex also supports multi-agent systems through its llama-agents framework, per [Introducing llama-agents: A Powerful Framework for Building Production Multi-Agent AI Systems — LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/introducing-llama-agents-a-powerful-framework-for-building-production-multi-agent-ai-systems).\\n\\n## The comparison is summarized in the following table:\\n\\n![]()\\n\\n# Chapter 4: Design Patterns in Agentic AI Systems\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nThis section explores five key design patterns: Reflection, Tool Use, ReAct, Planning, and Multi-Agent Collaboration. For each, we’ll explain what it is, why it matters, and show how to use tools like LangChain and AutoGen with sample code.\\n\\n## 4.1 Reflection Pattern\\n\\n![]()\\n\\n**What It Is**: The Reflection Pattern lets an AI review its own work to find mistakes and improve. It’s like an AI checking its essay for errors before submitting.\\n\\n**Why It Matters**: This helps the AI get better over time, reducing errors in tasks like writing code or creating content, which is crucial for reliability.\\n\\n**Tools and Frameworks**: Use LangChain, especially its LangGraph part, for this. LangGraph lets the AI cycle through its work, reviewing and refining.\\n\\n**Sample Code**:\\n\\n```\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough\\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\n\\n# Set up generator to write an essay\\ngenerator_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"You are an essay assistant tasked with writing excellent 5-paragraph essays.\"),\\n    (\"human\", \"{input}\"),\\n])\\ngenerator = generator_prompt | ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\") | AIMessage.log()\\n\\n# Set up reflector to grade and give feedback\\nreflect_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"You are an essay grader tasked with grading essays and providing feedback.\"),\\n    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"history\"),\\n    (\"human\", \"Grade the following essay and provide feedback: {input}\"),\\n])\\nreflector = reflect_prompt | ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\") | AIMessage.log()\\n\\n# Combine them in a cycle, stopping after 3 iterations\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableBranch\\n\\ndef should_reflect(input):\\n    return len(input[\"history\"]) < 3\\n\\ngraph = RunnableBranch(\\n    (should_reflect, generator | reflector),\\n    RunnablePassthrough(),\\n)\\n\\n# Run it for an essay on AI ethics\\ninput_text = \"Write a 5-paragraph essay on \\'The Importance of AI Ethics\\'.\"\\nresult = graph.invoke({\"input\": input_text, \"history\": []})\\nprint(result)\\n```\\n\\n> This code shows the AI writing an essay, then checking and improving it up to three times, making it better each round.\\n\\n## 4.2 Tool Use Pattern\\n\\n![]()\\n\\n**What It Is**: The Tool Use Pattern lets the AI use external tools, like web search or APIs, to get information or do tasks it can’t do on its own.\\n\\n**Why It Matters**: This makes the AI more versatile, letting it handle real-world tasks like finding facts online or doing math, which it couldn’t do just from memory.\\n\\n**Tools and Frameworks**: LangChain is great here, with tools like DuckDuckGoSearchRun for web searches, making it easy to extend the AI’s abilities.\\n\\n**Sample Code**:\\n\\n```\\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_tools\\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\\n\\n# Set up the AI model\\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\\n\\n# Load tools for web search and math\\ntools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\\n\\n# Create an agent that uses these tools\\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=\"zero-shot-react-description\", verbose=True)\\n\\n# Ask a complex question\\nresult = agent.run(\"Who is Olivia Wilde\\'s boyfriend? What is his current age raised to the 0.23 power?\")\\nprint(result)\\n```\\n\\n> Here, the AI searches the web to find Olivia Wilde’s boyfriend and uses a math tool to calculate his age raised to a power, showing how tools expand its capabilities.\\n\\n## 4.3 ReAct Pattern\\n\\n![]()\\n\\n**What It Is**: The ReAct Pattern, or “Reason and Act,” means the AI thinks through a problem step by step and then takes actions, like using tools, based on that thinking. It’s like planning and doing at the same time.\\n\\n**Why It Matters**: This helps the AI solve tricky problems by combining thinking and doing, making it more dynamic and able to handle tasks that need both, like answering multi-part questions.\\n\\n**Tools and Frameworks**: LangChain supports this with its “zero-shot-react-description” agent, which reasons and uses tools in a loop, perfect for ReAct.\\n\\n**Sample Code**:\\n\\n```\\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_tools\\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\\n\\n# Set up the AI model\\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\\n\\n# Load tools for web search and math\\ntools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\\n\\n# Create a ReAct agent\\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=\"zero-shot-react-description\", verbose=True)\\n\\n# Ask a question needing both reasoning and action\\nresult = agent.run(\"What is the current population of France? How does it compare to Germany?\")\\nprint(result)\\n```\\n\\n> The AI reasons about what to do (find populations and compare), then uses web search to get the numbers and reasons through the comparison, showing ReAct in action.\\n\\n## 4.4 Planning Pattern\\n\\n![]()\\n\\n**What It Is**: The Planning Pattern means the AI breaks down big tasks into smaller steps and makes a plan to tackle them, like outlining a project before starting.\\n\\n**Why It Matters**: This is key for complex tasks, ensuring the AI organizes work into manageable parts, making it efficient for long-term goals like planning a trip or diagnosing a patient.\\n\\n**Tools and Frameworks**: AutoGen is great for this, with features for multi-agent systems where a planner agent coordinates subtasks, like in medical diagnostics.\\n\\n**Sample Code**:\\n\\n```\\nimport autogen\\n\\n# Define agents for each part of the task\\nsymptom_agent = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Symptom_Agent\", ...)\\nhistory_agent = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"History_Agent\", ...)\\nanalysis_agent = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Analysis_Agent\", ...)\\nrecommendation_agent = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Recommendation_Agent\", ...)\\n\\n# Define planner to coordinate\\nplanner = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Planner\", ...)\\n\\n# Set up user proxy to start the chat\\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(name=\"User_Proxy\", ...)\\n\\n# Create a group chat with all agents\\ngroupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, planner, symptom_agent, history_agent, analysis_agent, recommendation_agent], ...)\\n\\n# Run the chat, starting with a diagnosis task\\nmanager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat, llm_config=...)\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(manager, message=\"Diagnose a patient with symptoms X, Y, Z\")\\n```\\n\\nHere, the planner outlines steps like collecting symptoms and analyzing data, with each agent handling its part, showing how planning organizes complex tasks.\\n\\n## 4.5 Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern\\n\\n![]()\\n\\n**What It Is**: The Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern means several AI agents work together, each with a specific role, like a team where one plans, one codes, and one checks the work.\\n\\n**Why It Matters**: This is great for big projects, letting agents specialize and collaborate, making the system more robust for tasks like software development or customer support.\\n\\n**Tools and Frameworks**: AutoGen is designed for this, with group chats where agents communicate and delegate tasks, perfect for team-like workflows.\\n\\n**Sample Code:**\\n\\n```\\nimport autogen\\n\\n# Define agents with different roles\\nplanner = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Planner\", ...)\\ncoder = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Coder\", ...)\\ncritic = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Critic\", ...)\\n\\n# Set up user proxy to interact\\nuser_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(name=\"User_Proxy\", ...)\\n\\n# Create a group chat for collaboration\\ngroupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, planner, coder, critic], ...)\\n\\n# Run the chat, asking for a coding task\\nmanager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat, llm_config=...)\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(manager, message=\"Write a function to calculate Fibonacci sequence\")\\n```\\n\\n## 5: Design Patterns in Multi-Agent Systems\\n\\nThere are further subcategories of Multi Agent Systems\\n\\n## **5.1 Parallel Multi Agents**:\\n\\nMultiple agents work simultaneously on subtasks. Example: Document processing with text and image agents. In AutoGen, use group chats for parallel execution. **Sample code:**\\n\\n```\\nassistant1 = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Assistant1\", ...)\\nassistant2 = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Assistant2\", ...)\\ngroupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, assistant1, assistant2], ...)\\n```\\n\\n## **5.2 Sequential Agents**:\\n\\nAgents perform tasks in sequence. Example: Data pipeline (cleaning → analysis). In LangChain, use chains for sequential execution. **Sample code:**\\n\\n```\\nchain = LLMChain(llm=llm) | Tool(\"tool_name\") | LLMChain(llm=llm)\\n```\\n\\n## **5.3 Loop Agents**:\\n\\nAgents repeat tasks until a condition is met. Example: Iterative solution refinement. Custom logic in AutoGen. **Sample code:**\\n\\n```\\nwhile not condition_met:\\n    response = assistant.generate()\\n```\\n\\n## **5.4 Router Agent**:\\n\\nAn agent directs tasks to specialized agents. Example: Customer support routing. In AutoGen, use a router agent. **Sample code:**\\n\\n```\\nrouter = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Router\", ...)\\nworker1 = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Worker1\", ...)\\n```\\n\\n## **5.5 Aggregator Agent**:\\n\\nCollects and combines results from multiple agents. Example: Merging search results. Custom aggregator in AutoGen. **Sample code:**\\n\\n```\\naggregator = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Aggregator\", ...)\\n```\\n\\n## **5.6 Network Agent**:\\n\\nAgents connected in a network topology for communication. Example: Sensor networks. Custom setup in LangChain or AutoGen. **Sample code:**\\n\\n```\\nagent1.add_tool(agent2.tool)\\nagent2.add_tool(agent3.tool)\\n```\\n\\n## **5.7 Hierarchical Agents**:\\n\\nAgents organized in levels, with higher levels controlling lower ones. Example: Company structure. In AutoGen, use hierarchical agent setup. **Sample code:**\\n\\n```\\nexecutive = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Executive\", ...)\\nmanager = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Manager\", ...)\\nworker = autogen.AssistantAgent(name=\"Worker\", ...)\\n```\\n\\n# 6. Conclusion\\n\\nAgentic AI is transforming AI development, with frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and AutoGen providing robust tools for building autonomous systems. The choice between single and multi-agent architectures depends on task complexity, with design patterns offering structured solutions for multi-agent interactions. As of April 8, 2025, the field continues to evolve, with ongoing research addressing challenges like bias and alignment, promising significant industry impacts.\\n\\n# 7.

week, I described four design patterns for AI agentic workflows that I believe will drive significant progress: Reflection, Tool use, Planning and Multi-agent collaboration. Instead of having an LLM generate its final output directly, an agentic workflow prompts the LLM multiple times, giving it opportunities to build step by step to higher-quality output. Here, I\\'d like to discuss Reflection. It\\'s relatively quick to implement, and I\\'ve seen it lead to surprising performance gains.\\nYou may have had the experience of prompting ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini, receiving unsatisfactory output, delivering critical feedback to help the LLM improve its response, and then getting a better response. What if you automate the step of delivering critical feedback, so the model automatically criticizes its own output and improves its response? This is the crux of Reflection.\\nTake the task of asking an LLM to write code. We can prompt it to generate the desired code directly to carry out some task X. Then, we can prompt it to reflect on its own output, perhaps as follows:\\nHere’s code intended for task X:\\n[previously generated code]\\nCheck the code carefully for correctness, style, and efficiency, and give constructive criticism for how to improve it.\\nSometimes this causes the LLM to spot problems and come up with constructive suggestions. Next, we can prompt the LLM with context including (i) the previously generated code and (ii) the constructive feedback, and ask it to use the feedback to rewrite the code. This can lead to a better response. Repeating the criticism/rewrite process might yield further improvements. This self-reflection process allows the LLM to spot gaps and improve its output on a variety of tasks including producing code, writing text, and answering questions.\\nAnd we can go beyond self-reflection by giving the LLM tools that help evaluate its output; for example, running its code through a few unit tests to check whether it generates correct results on test cases or searching the web to double-check text output. Then it can reflect on any errors it found and come up with ideas for improvement.\\nFurther, we can implement Reflection using a multi-agent framework. I\\'ve found it convenient to create two agents, one prompted to generate good outputs and the other prompted to give constructive criticism of the first agent\\'s output. The resulting discussion between the two agents leads to improved responses.\\nReflection is a relatively basic type of agentic workflow, but I\\'ve been delighted by how much it improved my applications’ results.

Some might find is not fully aligned with the topic, but still, having so many great minds and thinkers, we can at least share some inputs to understand or through some light on other relevant queries.\\nAre we trying to train LLM to criticize its own incorrect responses to get a better one?\\nWhy do we want everything out of it? What is the intent behind it?\\nInstead of honing our own skills, knowledge, and expertise every single time in order to enhance human capabilities and intelligence, why our only goal is to achieve enhanced machine performance.\\nThough it\\'s important to do so to a certain extent, why the whole efforts are all about making humans 2nd?\\nIt feels like humans are planning their own whitewash. We need to use these tools as a screwdriver in our creation and upskilling process so that they can strengthen human intelligence.\\nBut if we are just ready to sit and watch things happen, becoming the laziest species on the planet, then in the next 10 years we might not even need our hands or might sense too.

This however has the challenge of compounding errors, bias, and outpacing human comprehension through rapid synthetic interactions.

Agentic AI. Agentic architectures. Agentic workflows. Agentic patterns. Agents are everywhere. But what exactly *are* they, and how do we build robust and effective agentic systems? While the term \"agent\" is used broadly, a key characteristic is their ability to dynamically plan and execute tasks, often leveraging external tools and memory to achieve complex goals.\\n\\nThis post aims to explore common design patterns. Think of these patterns as blueprints or reusable templates for building AI applications. Understanding them provides a mental model for tackling complex problems and designing systems that are scalable, modular, and adaptable.\\n\\nWe\\'ll dive into several common patterns, differentiating between more structured **workflows** and more dynamic **agentic patterns**. Workflows typically follow predefined paths, while agents have more autonomy in deciding their course of action.\\n\\n**Why Do (Agentic) Patterns Matter?**\\n\\n* Patterns provide a structured way to think and design systems.\\n* Patterns allow us to build and grow AI applications in complexity and adapt to changing requirements. Modular designs based on patterns are easier to modify and extend.\\n* Patterns help manage the complexity of coordinating multiple agents, tools, and workflows by offering proven, reusable templates. They promote best practices and shared understanding among developers.\\n\\n**When (and When Not) to Use Agents?**\\n\\nBefore diving into patterns, it\\'s crucial to consider *when* an agentic approach is truly necessary.\\n\\n* Always seek the simplest solution first. If you know the exact steps required to solve a problem, a fixed workflow or even a simple script might be more efficient and reliable than a agent.\\n* Agentic systems often trade increased latency and computational cost for potentially better performance on complex, ambiguous, or dynamic tasks. Be sure the benefits outweigh these costs.\\n* Use **workflows** for predictability and consistency when dealing with well-defined tasks where the steps are known.\\n* Use **agents** when flexibility, adaptability, and model-driven decision-making are needed.\\n* Keep it Simple (Still): Even when building agentic systems, strive for the simplest effective design. Overly complex agent can become difficult to debug and manage.\\n* Agency introduces inherent unpredictability and potential errors. Agentic systems must incorporate robust error logging, exception handling, and retry mechanisms, allowing the system (or the underlying LLM) a chance to self-correct.\\n\\nBelow, we\\'ll explore 3 common workflow patterns and 4 agentic patterns. We\\'ll illustrate each using pure API calls, without relying on specific frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or CrewAI, to focus on the core concepts.\\n\\n## Pattern Overview\\n\\nWe will cover the following patterns:\\n\\n* [Pattern Overview](#pattern-overview)\\n* [Workflow: Prompt Chaining](#workflow-prompt-chaining)\\n* [Workflow: Routing or Handoff](#workflow-routing-or-handoff)\\n* [Workflow: Parallelization](#workflow-parallelization)\\n* [Reflection Pattern](#reflection-pattern)\\n* [Tool Use Pattern](#tool-use-pattern)\\n* [Planning Pattern (Orchestrator-Workers)](#planning-pattern-orchestrator-workers)\\n* [Multi-Agent Pattern](#multi-agent-pattern)\\n\\n## Workflow: Prompt Chaining\\n\\n![](/static/blog/agentic-pattern/prompt-chaining.png)\\n\\nThe output of one LLM call sequentially feeds into the input of the next LLM call. This pattern decomposes a task into a fixed sequence of steps. Each step is handled by an LLM call that processes the output from the preceding one. It\\'s suitable for tasks that can be cleanly broken down into predictable, sequential subtasks.\\n\\nUse Cases:\\n\\n* Generating a structured document: LLM 1 creates an outline, LLM 2 validates the outline against criteria, LLM 3 writes the content based on the validated outline.\\n* Multi-step data processing: Extracting information, transforming it, and then summarizing it.\\n* Generating newsletters based on curated inputs.\\n\\n```\\nimport os\\nfrom google import genai\\n\\n# Configure the client (ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set in your environment)\\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ[\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"])\\n\\n# --- Step 1: Summarize Text ---\\noriginal_text = \"Large language models are powerful AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data. They can generate human-like text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.\"\\nprompt1 = f\"Summarize the following text in one sentence: {original_text}\"\\n\\n# Use client.models.generate_content\\nresponse1 = client.models.generate_content(\\n    model=\\'gemini-2.0-flash\\',\\n    contents=prompt1\\n)\\nsummary = response1.text.strip()\\nprint(f\"Summary: {summary}\")\\n\\n# --- Step 2: Translate the Summary ---\\nprompt2 = f\"Translate the following summary into French, only return the translation, no other text: {summary}\"\\n\\n# Use client.models.generate_content\\nresponse2 = client.models.generate_content(\\n    model=\\'gemini-2.0-flash\\',\\n    contents=prompt2\\n)\\ntranslation = response2.text.strip()\\nprint(f\"Translation: {translation}\")\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Workflow: Routing\\n\\n![](/static/blog/agentic-pattern/routing-or-handoff.png)\\n\\nAn initial LLM acts as a router, classifying the user\\'s input and directing it to the most appropriate specialized task or LLM. This pattern implements a separation of concerns and allows for optimizing individual downstream tasks (using specialized prompts, different models, or specific tools) in isolation. It improves efficiency and potentially reduces costs by using smaller models for simpler tasks. When a task is routed, the selected agent \"takes over\" responsibility for completion.\\n\\nUse Cases:\\n\\n* Customer support systems: Routing queries to agents specialized in billing, technical support, or product information.\\n* Tiered LLM usage: Routing simple queries to faster, cheaper models (like Llama 3.1 8B) and complex or unusual questions to more capable models (like Gemini 1.5 Pro).\\n* Content generation: Routing requests for blog posts, social media updates, or ad copy to different specialized prompts/models.\\n\\n```\\nimport os\\nimport json\\nfrom google import genai\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\nimport enum\\n\\n# Configure the client (ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set in your environment)\\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ[\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"])\\n\\n# Define Routing Schema\\nclass Category(enum.Enum):\\n    WEATHER = \"weather\"\\n    SCIENCE = \"science\"\\n    UNKNOWN = \"unknown\"\\n\\nclass RoutingDecision(BaseModel):\\n    category: Category\\n    reasoning: str\\n\\n# Step 1: Route the Query\\nuser_query = \"What\\'s the weather like in Paris?\"\\n# user_query = \"Explain quantum physics simply.\"\\n# user_query = \"What is the capital of France?\"\\n\\nprompt_router = f\"\"\"\\nAnalyze the user query below and determine its category.\\nCategories:\\n- weather: For questions about weather conditions.\\n- science: For questions about science.\\n- unknown: If the category is unclear.\\n\\nQuery: {user_query}\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n# Use client.models.generate_content with config for structured output\\nresponse_router = client.models.generate_content(\\n    model= \\'gemini-2.0-flash-lite\\',\\n    contents=prompt_router,\\n    config={\\n        \\'response_mime_type\\': \\'application/json\\',\\n        \\'response_schema\\': RoutingDecision,\\n    },\\n)\\nprint(f\"Routing Decision: Category={response_router.parsed.category}, Reasoning={response_router.parsed.reasoning}\")\\n\\n# Step 2: Handoff based on Routing\\nfinal_response = \"\"\\nif response_router.parsed.category == Category.WEATHER:\\n    weather_prompt = f\"Provide a brief weather forecast for the location mentioned in: \\'{user_query}\\'\"\\n    weather_response = client.models.generate_content(\\n        model=\\'gemini-2.0-flash\\',\\n        contents=weather_prompt\\n    )\\n    final_response = weather_response.text\\nelif response_router.parsed.category == Category.SCIENCE:\\n    science_response = client.models.generate_content(\\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17\",\\n        contents=user_query\\n    )\\n    final_response = science_response.text\\nelse:\\n    unknown_response = client.models.generate_content(\\n        model=\"gemini-2.0-flash-lite\",\\n        contents=f\"The user query is: {prompt_router}, but could not be answered. Here is the reasoning: {response_router.parsed.reasoning}. Write a helpful response to the user for him to try again.\"\\n    )\\n    final_response = unknown_response.text\\nprint(f\"\\\\nFinal Response: {final_response}\")\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Workflow: Parallelization\\n\\n![](/static/blog/agentic-pattern/parallelization.png)\\n\\nA task is broken down into independent subtasks that are processed simultaneously by multiple LLMs, with their outputs being aggregated. This pattern uses concurrency for tasks. The initial query (or parts of it) is sent to multiple LLMs in parallel with individual prompts/goals. Once all branches are complete, their individual results are collected and passed to a final aggregator LLM, which synthesizes them into the final response. This can improve latency if subtasks don\\'t depend on each other, or enhance quality through techniques like majority voting or generating diverse options.\\n\\nUse Cases:\\n\\n* RAG with query decomposition: Breaking a complex query into sub-queries, running retrievals for each in parallel, and synthesizing the results.\\n* Analyzing large documents: Dividing the document into sections, summarizing each section in parallel, and then combining the summaries.\\n* Generating multiple perspectives: Asking multiple LLMs the same question with different persona prompts and aggregating their responses.\\n* Map-reduce style operations on data.\\n\\n```\\nimport os\\nimport asyncio\\nimport time\\nfrom google import genai\\n\\n# Configure the client (ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set in your environment)\\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ[\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"])\\n\\nasync def generate_content(prompt: str) -> str:\\n        response = await client.aio.models.generate_content(\\n            model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\\n            contents=prompt\\n        )\\n        return response.text.strip()\\n\\nasync def parallel_tasks():\\n    # Define Parallel Tasks\\n    topic = \"a friendly robot exploring a jungle\"\\n    prompts = [\\n        f\"Write a short, adventurous story idea about {topic}.\",\\n        f\"Write a short, funny story idea about {topic}.\",\\n        f\"Write a short, mysterious story idea about {topic}.\"\\n    ]\\n    # Run tasks concurrently and gather results\\n    start_time = time.time()\\n    tasks = [generate_content(prompt) for prompt in prompts]\\n    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\\n    end_time = time.time()\\n    print(f\"Time taken: {end_time - start_time} seconds\")\\n\\n    print(\"\\\\n--- Individual Results ---\")\\n    for i, result in enumerate(results):\\n        print(f\"Result {i+1}: {result}\\\\n\")\\n\\n    # Aggregate results and generate final story\\n    story_ideas = \\'\\\\n\\'.join([f\"Idea {i+1}: {result}\" for i, result in enumerate(results)])\\n    aggregation_prompt = f\"Combine the following three story ideas into a single, cohesive summary paragraph:{story_ideas}\"\\n    aggregation_response = await client.aio.models.generate_content(\\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17\",\\n        contents=aggregation_prompt\\n    )\\n    return aggregation_response.text\\n\\nresult = await parallel_tasks()\\nprint(f\"\\\\n--- Aggregated Summary ---\\\\n{result}\")\\n```\\n\\n## Reflection Pattern\\n\\n![](/static/blog/agentic-pattern/reflection.png)\\n\\nAn agent evaluates its own output and uses that feedback to refine its response iteratively. This pattern is also known as Evaluator-Optimizer and uses a self-correction loop. An initial LLM generates a response or completes a task. A second LLM step (or even the same LLM with a different prompt) then acts as a reflector or evaluator, critiquing the initial output against the requirements or desired quality. This critique (feedback) is then fed back, prompting the LLM to produce a refined output. This cycle can repeat until the evaluator confirms the requirements are met or a satisfing output is achieved.\\n\\nUse Cases:\\n\\n* Code generation: Writing code, executing it, using error messages or test results as feedback to fix bugs.\\n* Writing and refinement: Generating a draft, reflecting on its clarity and tone, and then revising it.\\n* Complex problem solving: Generating a plan, evaluating its feasibility, and refining it based on the evaluation.\\n* Information retrieval: Searching for information and using an evaluator LLM to check if all required details were found before presenting the answer.\\n\\n```\\nimport os\\nimport json\\nfrom google import genai\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\nimport enum\\n\\n# Configure the client (ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set in your environment)\\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ[\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"])\\n\\nclass EvaluationStatus(enum.Enum):\\n    PASS = \"PASS\"\\n    FAIL = \"FAIL\"\\n\\nclass Evaluation(BaseModel):\\n    evaluation: EvaluationStatus\\n    feedback: str\\n    reasoning: str\\n\\n# --- Initial Generation Function ---\\ndef generate_poem(topic: str, feedback: str = None) -> str:\\n    prompt = f\"Write a short, four-line poem about {topic}.\"\\n    if feedback:\\n        prompt += f\"\\\\nIncorporate this feedback: {feedback}\"\\n\\n    response = client.models.generate_content(\\n        model=\\'gemini-2.0-flash\\',\\n        contents=prompt\\n    )\\n    poem = response.text.strip()\\n    print(f\"Generated Poem:\\\\n{poem}\")\\n    return poem\\n\\n# --- Evaluation Function ---\\ndef evaluate(poem: str) -> Evaluation:\\n    print(\"\\\\n--- Evaluating Poem ---\")\\n    prompt_critique = f\"\"\"Critique the following poem. Does it rhyme well? Is it exactly four lines?\\nIs it creative? Respond with PASS or FAIL and provide feedback.\\n\\nPoem:\\n{poem}\\n\"\"\"\\n    response_critique = client.models.generate_content(\\n        model=\\'gemini-2.0-flash\\',\\n        contents=prompt_critique,\\n        config={\\n            \\'response_mime_type\\': \\'application/json\\',\\n            \\'response_schema\\': Evaluation,\\n        },\\n    )\\n    critique = response_critique.parsed\\n    print(f\"Evaluation Status: {critique.evaluation}\")\\n    print(f\"Evaluation Feedback: {critique.feedback}\")\\n    return critique\\n\\n# Reflection Loop\\nmax_iterations = 3\\ncurrent_iteration = 0\\ntopic = \"a robot learning to paint\"\\n\\n# simulated poem which will not pass the evaluation\\ncurrent_poem = \"With circuits humming, cold and bright,\\\\nA metal hand now holds a brush\"\\n\\nwhile current_iteration < max_iterations:\\n    current_iteration += 1\\n    print(f\"\\\\n--- Iteration {current_iteration} ---\")\\n    evaluation_result = evaluate(current_poem)\\n\\n    if evaluation_result.evaluation == EvaluationStatus.PASS:\\n        print(\"\\\\nFinal Poem:\")\\n        print(current_poem)\\n        break\\n    else:\\n        current_poem = generate_poem(topic, feedback=evaluation_result.feedback)\\n        if current_iteration == max_iterations:\\n            print(\"\\\\nMax iterations reached. Last attempt:\")\\n            print(current_poem)\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Tool Use Pattern\\n\\n![](/static/blog/agentic-pattern/tool-use.png)\\n\\nLLM has the ability to invoke external functions or APIs to interact with the outside world, retrieve information, or perform actions. This pattern often referred to as Function Calling and is the most widely recognized pattern. The LLM is provided with definitions (name, description, input schema) of available tools (functions, APIs, databases, etc.). Based on the user query, the LLM can decide to call one or more tools by generating a structured output (like JSON) matching the required schema. This output is used to execute the actual external tool/function, and the result is returned to the LLM. The LLM then uses this result to formulate its final response to the user. This vastly extends the LLM\\'s capabilities beyond its training data.\\n\\nUse Cases:\\n\\n* Booking appointments using a calendar API.\\n* Retrieving real-time stock prices via a financial API.\\n* Searching a vector database for relevant documents (RAG).\\n* Controlling smart home devices.\\n* Executing code snippets.\\n\\n```\\nimport os\\nfrom google import genai\\nfrom google.genai import types\\n\\n# Configure the client (ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set in your environment)\\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ[\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"])\\n\\n# Define the function declaration for the model\\nweather_function = {\\n    \"name\": \"get_current_temperature\",\\n    \"description\": \"Gets the current temperature for a given location.\",\\n    \"parameters\": {\\n        \"type\": \"object\",\\n        \"properties\": {\\n            \"location\": {\\n                \"type\": \"string\",\\n                \"description\": \"The city name, e.g. San Francisco\",\\n            },\\n        },\\n        \"required\": [\"location\"],\\n    },\\n}\\n\\n# Placeholder function to simulate API call\\ndef get_current_temperature(location: str) -> dict:\\n    return {\"temperature\": \"15\", \"unit\": \"Celsius\"}\\n\\n# Create the config object as shown in the user\\'s example\\n# Use client.models.generate_content with model, contents, and config\\ntools = types.Tool(function_declarations=[weather_function])\\ncontents = [\"What\\'s the temperature in London right now?\"]\\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\\n    model=\\'gemini-2.0-flash\\',\\n    contents=contents,\\n    config = types.GenerateContentConfig(tools=[tools])\\n)\\n\\n# Process the Response (Check for Function Call)\\nresponse_part = response.candidates[0].content.parts[0]\\nif response_part.function_call:\\n    function_call = response_part.function_call\\n    print(f\"Function to call: {function_call.name}\")\\n    print(f\"Arguments: {dict(function_call.args)}\")\\n\\n    # Execute the Function\\n    if function_call.name == \"get_current_temperature\":\\n        # Call the actual function\\n        api_result = get_current_temperature(*function_call.args)\\n        # Append function call and result of the function execution to contents\\n        follow_up_contents = [\\n            types.Part(function_call=function_call),\\n            types.Part.from_function_response(\\n                name=\"get_current_temperature\",\\n                response=api_result\\n            )\\n        ]\\n        # Generate final response\\n        response_final = client.models.generate_content(\\n            model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\\n            contents=contents + follow_up_contents,\\n            config=types.GenerateContentConfig(tools=[tools])\\n        )\\n        print(response_final.text)\\n    else:\\n        print(f\"Error: Unknown function call requested: {function_call.name}\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\"No function call found in the response.\")\\n    print(response.text)\\n```\\n\\n## Planning Pattern (Orchestrator-Workers)\\n\\n![](/static/blog/agentic-pattern/planning.png)\\n\\nA central planner LLM breaks down a complex task into a dynamic list of subtasks, which are then delegated to specialized worker agents (often using Tool Use) for execution. This pattern tries to solve complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning by creating an intial Plan. This plan is dynamically generated based on the user input. Subtasks are then assigned to \"Worker\" agents that execute them, potentially in parallel if dependencies allow. An \"Orchestrator\" or \"Synthesizer\" LLM collects the results from the workers, reflects on whether the overall goal has been achieved, and either synthesizes the final output or potentially initiates a re-planning step if necessary. This reduces the cognitive load on any single LLM call, improves reasoning quality, minimizes errors, and allows for dynamic adaptation of the workflow. The key difference from Routing is that the Planner generates a *multi-step plan* rather than selecting a single next step.\\n\\nUse Cases:\\n\\n* Complex software development tasks: Breaking down \"build a feature\" into planning, coding, testing, and documentation subtasks.\\n* Research and report generation: Planning steps like literature search, data extraction, analysis, and report writing.\\n* Multi-modal tasks: Planning steps involving image generation, text analysis, and data integration.\\n* Executing complex user requests like \"Plan a 3-day trip to Paris, book flights and a hotel within my budget.\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nimport os\\nfrom google import genai\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\nfrom typing import List\\n\\n# Configure the client (ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set in your environment)\\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ[\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"])\\n\\n# Define the Plan Schema\\nclass Task(BaseModel):\\n    task_id: int\\n    description: str\\n    assigned_to: str = Field(description=\"Which worker type should handle this?

This pattern uses autonomous or semi-autonomous agents. Each agent might have a unique role (e.g., Project Manager, Coder, Tester, Critic), specialized knowledge, or access to specific tools. They interact and collaborate, often coordinated by a central \"coordinator\" or \"manager\" agent (like the PM in the diagram) or using handoff logic, where one agent passes the control to another agent.\\n\\nUse Cases:\\n\\n* Simulating debates or brainstorming sessions with different AI personas.\\n* Complex software creation involving agents for planning, coding, testing, and deployment.\\n* Running virtual experiments or simulations with agents representing different actors.\\n* Collaborative writing or content creation processes.\\n\\nNote: The example below a simplified example on how to use the Multi-Agent pattern with handoff logic and structured output. I recommend to take a look at [LangGraph Multi-Agent Swarm](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-swarm-py) or [Crew AI](https://www.crewai.com/open-source)\\n\\n```\\nfrom google import genai\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\n\\n# Configure the client (ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set in your environment)\\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ[\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"])\\n\\n# Define Structured Output Schemas\\nclass Response(BaseModel):\\n    handoff: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"The name/role of the agent to hand off to.

Real-world agentic systems often combine elements from multiple patterns. A Planning agent might use Tool Use, and its workers could employ Reflection.

One such paradigm that’s increasingly redefining intelligent systems is **Agentic Design Patterns**. These patterns aren’t just about individual AI agents solving tasks; they’re about creating a symphony of intelligence, orchestrating agents, tools, and workflows into seamless systems that think, plan, and act.\\n\\nIn this blog, I’ll share my take on what Agentic Design Patterns are, why they matter, and how they can be applied effectively. From reflections to multi-agent strategies, we’ll explore how these patterns are reshaping architecture and design flow, making systems not just smarter but purpose-driven.\\n\\n# What Are Agentic Design Patterns?\\n\\nAt their core, Agentic Design Patterns are architectural and behavioral templates that guide the development of AI systems where agents (autonomous or semi-autonomous entities) collaborate with tools, environments, and sometimes each other. These patterns encapsulate common workflows and interactions, enabling scalability, modularity, and adaptability.\\n\\nThink of an agent not just as a standalone AI but as part of a well-coordinated team, equipped with tools and processes to tackle complex problems. Whether it’s a single agent reasoning about tasks or a fleet of agents handling intricate workflows, Agentic Design Patterns provide the blueprint.\\n\\n# Why Do Agentic Design Patterns Matter?\\n\\nIn my experience, the biggest challenges in AI system design come down to two things: **scalability** and **adaptability**. Here’s where Agentic Design Patterns shine:\\n\\n1. **Streamlined Architecture:**\\n   Patterns simplify the complexity of managing multiple agents, tools, and workflows by offering reusable templates.\\n2. **Efficient Collaboration:**\\n   They enable agents to share context, divide tasks, and collaborate efficiently, reducing redundancies and maximizing outcomes.\\n3. **Scalability:**\\n   By modularizing workflows, these patterns allow systems to scale seamlessly with growing demands or additional functionalities.\\n4. **Adaptability:**\\n   They offer flexibility to evolve workflows dynamically, adapting to new tools, data, or goals without overhauling the system.\\n\\n# Agentic Design Patterns: Evaluations\\n\\nWhen evaluating Agentic Design Patterns, three metrics stand out:\\n\\n**Efficiency:**\\n\\n* How well do agents and tools collaborate to minimize latency and maximize throughput?\\n* Example: Does a planning agent quickly align with tool agents without redundant processing?\\n\\n**Robustness:**\\n\\n* How resilient is the system to failures, missing data, or changing requirements?\\n* Example: Does the system degrade gracefully when an agent or tool encounters an issue?\\n\\n**Scalability:**\\n\\n* How does the system handle an increasing number of tasks, agents, or complexity?\\n* Example: Can you add more agents or expand the workflow without introducing bottlenecks?\\n\\n# 4 Types of Agentic Design Patterns You Must Know\\n\\nLet’s dive into the core patterns. Each of these reflects a different approach to designing intelligent systems, tailored to specific needs and workflows.\\n\\n## 1. Reflection Pattern\\n\\nThe Reflection Pattern empowers agents to introspect and evaluate their actions or decisions. This pattern is about iterative improvement, where agents not only perform tasks but also analyze outcomes to refine their approach.\\n\\n**Key Features:**\\n\\n* **Self-Evaluation:** Agents assess their performance using metrics or goals.\\n* **Feedback Loops:** They adjust their strategies based on the evaluation.\\n* **Scenario:** A recommendation agent reflects on user feedback to improve its suggestions.\\n\\n**Design Flow:**\\n\\n1. Agent performs an action.\\n2. Collects results or outcomes.\\n3. Reflects on the outcomes against predefined metrics or goals.\\n4. Refines strategy or logic based on reflection.\\n\\n**Example in Practice:**\\nImagine a trading bot that analyzes its daily portfolio performance:\\n\\n1. **Action:** The bot executes a series of trades during market hours based on predefined strategies.\\n2. **Outcome Collection:** At the end of the day, it gathers data on the profitability, risk exposure, and execution accuracy of these trades.\\n3. **Reflection:** It evaluates performance metrics, identifying patterns like underperforming strategies or missed opportunities.\\n4. **Refinement:** Based on its analysis, the bot adjusts its algorithms for the next trading day, such as tightening risk limits or prioritizing high-yield strategies.\\n\\n## 2. Tool Use Pattern\\n\\nThe Tool Use Pattern emphasizes equipping agents with external tools or APIs to extend their capabilities. This pattern allows agents to delegate specialized tasks rather than performing everything internally.\\n\\n**Key Features:**\\n\\n* **Specialized Functionality:** Agents call tools for tasks like data retrieval, transformation, or complex computations.\\n* **Interoperability:** Seamlessly integrates tools into workflows.\\n* **Scenario:** An AI agent uses an external API to fetch stock prices and another tool for sentiment analysis.\\n\\n**Design Flow:**\\n\\n1. Agent identifies a task that requires a tool.\\n2. Calls the appropriate tool with context or parameters.\\n3. Receives processed results from the tool.\\n4. Integrates the results into its workflow.\\n\\n**Example in Practice:**\\nA customer support bot retrieves billing information:\\n\\n1. **Task Identification:** A user asks for their latest bill details. The bot recognizes that this requires external data.\\n2. **Tool Invocation:** It calls the company’s billing API, sending the user ID and required date range.\\n3. **Data Retrieval:** The API returns the requested billing information.\\n4. **Response:** The bot formats the data and provides the user with a clear summary, such as their outstanding balance and due date.\\n\\n## 3. Planning Pattern\\n\\nThe Planning Pattern is about agents formulating and executing multi-step plans to achieve complex objectives. It enables systems to dynamically adapt their workflows based on goals and constraints.\\n\\n**Key Features:**\\n\\n* **Dynamic Goal Alignment:** Plans are generated in real-time based on inputs or changes.\\n* **Sequential Execution:** Agents execute plans step-by-step, ensuring dependencies are managed.\\n* **Scenario:** A logistics agent plans delivery routes by optimizing for distance, fuel cost, and traffic conditions.\\n\\n**Design Flow:**\\n\\n1. Define goals or objectives.\\n2. Analyze available resources and constraints.\\n3. Generate a sequence of actions to achieve the goals.\\n4. Execute the plan while monitoring outcomes.\\n\\n**Example in Practice:**\\nAn AI-driven banking assistant automates loan approvals:\\n\\n1. **Goal Definition:** The system aims to process 500 loan applications in a day, ensuring risk compliance and customer satisfaction.\\n2. **Resource Analysis:** It evaluates available data, including applicant credit scores, income verification, and past repayment history.\\n3. **Plan Generation:** The AI generates a prioritized workflow, grouping applications by complexity (e.g., pre-approved, manual review required).\\n4. **Execution and Monitoring:** The assistant processes simpler applications automatically while routing high-risk cases to human reviewers, ensuring smooth and compliant operations.\\n\\n## 4. Multi-Agent Pattern\\n\\nThe Multi-Agent Pattern focuses on orchestrating multiple agents to work collaboratively on complex tasks. This pattern leverages agent specialization and parallelism.\\n\\n**Key Features:**\\n\\n* **Division of Labor:** Agents handle different aspects of a task.\\n* **Coordination:** A central orchestrator ensures agents align their actions.\\n* **Scenario:** A marketing workflow involves one agent for content generation, another for scheduling, and a third for analytics.\\n\\n**Design Flow:**\\n\\n1. Assign tasks to specialized agents.\\n2. Share context or intermediate results between agents.\\n3. Orchestrate their actions to achieve the overall objective.\\n\\n**Example in Practice:**\\nA multi-agent trading system handles end-to-end trading workflows:\\n\\n1. **Task Assignment:** A Market Data Agent monitors live feeds, a Technical Analysis Agent identifies trends, and a Risk Assessment Agent evaluates the potential risks.\\n2. **Context Sharing:** The Market Data Agent shares relevant updates with the Technical Analysis Agent, which provides insights to the Risk Assessment Agent.\\n3. **Orchestration:** The Portfolio Management Agent consolidates all inputs and executes trades while ensuring adherence to risk thresholds and portfolio goals.\\n\\n# Reimagining Architecture with Agentic Patterns\\n\\nWhen building intelligent systems, these patterns provide a robust foundation for designing workflows. Here’s how they map into practical architecture:\\n\\n1. **Modularity:**\\n   Each pattern represents a module that can be plugged into larger systems. For example, a Tool Use module might feed data to a Planning module.\\n2. **Interoperability:**\\n   Patterns are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing technologies like OpenAI, LangChain, or cloud APIs.\\n3. **Scalability:**\\n   Systems built on these patterns grow organically, allowing new agents, tools, or workflows to be added without re-engineering.\\n\\n# The Future of Agentic Design\\n\\nAs I reflect on where we’re heading, I see a world where Agentic Design Patterns are no longer just theoretical but integral to every intelligent system. With AI’s evolution, these patterns will:\\n\\n1. **Emphasize Autonomy:**\\n   Agents will act as independent problem-solvers, reducing human oversight in routine tasks.\\n2. **Drive Collaboration:**\\n   Multi-agent systems will unlock synergies across industries, from healthcare to logistics.\\n3. **Bridge Human-AI Gaps:**\\n   Patterns like the Reflection Pattern will ensure systems remain transparent and accountable.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nAgentic Design Patterns are more than just architectural blueprints; they represent a transformative approach to building intelligent systems that think, plan, and act cohesively. These patterns are the bridge between isolated AI capabilities and fully integrated systems capable of solving real-world problems with precision and adaptability.\\n\\nThrough Reflection, Tool Use, Planning, and Multi-Agent collaboration, we unlock a future where workflows become more dynamic, decision-making more robust, and outcomes more impactful. Personally, applying these patterns has not only enhanced the scalability and resilience of the systems I work on but has also redefined how I approach problem-solving in complex domains like banking and finance.\\n\\nAs we move forward, these patterns will continue to evolve, shaping the next generation of intelligent systems.\\n\\n[Agentic Ai](/tag/agentic-ai?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Ai Agent](/tag/ai-agent?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Llm](/tag/llm?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Agent Based Modeling](/tag/agent-based-modeling?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Agentforce](/tag/agentforce?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n--\\n\\n--\\n\\n2\\n\\n[![Bijit Ghosh](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*QJV-EWQ-ORVL_lr7DwoU7A@2x.jpeg)](/%40bijit211987?source=post_page---post_author_info--cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[![Bijit Ghosh](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*QJV-EWQ-ORVL_lr7DwoU7A@2x.jpeg)](/%40bijit211987?source=post_page---post_author_info--cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[## Written by Bijit Ghosh](/%40bijit211987?source=post_page---post_author_info--cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[3.6K followers](/%40bijit211987/followers?source=post_page---post_author_info--cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n·[0 following](/%40bijit211987/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\nCTO | Senior Engineering Leader focused on Cloud Native | AI/ML | DevSecOps\\n\\n## Responses (2)\\n\\nSee all responses\\n\\n[Help](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Status](https://medium.statuspage.io/?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[About](/about?autoplay=1&source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Careers](/jobs-at-medium/work-at-medium-959d1a85284e?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\nPress\\n\\n[Blog](https://blog.medium.com/?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Privacy](https://policy.medium.com/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Rules](https://policy.medium.com/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Terms](https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Text to speech](https://speechify.com/medium?source=post_page-----cbd0aae2962f---------------------------------------)']\n",

As enterprises shift from passive AI tools to autonomous decision-makers, a new era is dawning: one where AI doesn’t just *assist*—it *acts*. Although academic work on autonomous agents dates back to the late 1990s—when agent-based process management systems first emerged—principles of agency were explored even earlier in social-cognitive theory. The explosive rise of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and leveraging reinforcement learning in 2023–24 catalyzed today’s agentic AI wave, enabling systems to chain multiple LLM prompts, tool calls, and decision logic into cohesive, autonomous workflows.\\n\\n### What is Agentic AI?\\n\\nAgentic AI refers to intelligent systems that can autonomously plan, initiate, and complete complex, multi-step tasks in dynamic environments. These agents are not merely reactive but operate with a sense of *goal-orientation*, continuously learning and adapting from their outcomes. Unlike traditional AI that relies on clear instructions, Agentic AI is designed to think strategically and iteratively, often redefining tasks midstream based on new data or context—very much like a human project manager would.\\n\\nWhile the broader concepts of autonomous agents have existed for years in robotics and cognitive science, the term “Agentic AI” gained mainstream traction thanks to work from OpenAI, Microsoft Research, and academic circles in 2023–2024. Microsoft’s AI Research blog defines it as “the next stage of generative intelligence—where agents act on your behalf, not just generate responses.”\\n\\n### Current Developments in Agentic AI\\n\\nAccording to Gartner, by 2026, over 60% of enterprise-level AI applications will feature agentic capabilities, up from less than 10% in 2023. VentureBeat reports a surge in investment: over $2.1 billion was poured into startups building agentic AI solutions in 2024 alone. Platforms like AutoGPT, BabyAGI, and MetaGPT have laid the groundwork, but enterprise-grade systems like OpenAI’s GPT-Enterprise, LangChain, and Microsoft’s Copilot Agents are bringing agentic AI to commercial scale. Notable developments include:\\n\\n1. **Workday’s Illuminate AI Agents**: Workday has introduced Illuminate AI Agents and an Agent System of Record (ASR) to automate tasks across HR, finance, and planning functions. These agents aim to boost efficiency and reduce overhead costs by automating routine tasks and queries.\\n2. **Johnson & Johnson’s AI Strategy**: Johnson & Johnson has refined its generative AI strategy, focusing on high-value applications such as drug discovery, supply chain management, and internal support tools. Their “Rep Copilot” assists sales reps in engaging healthcare professionals, demonstrating the practical impact of agentic AI.\\n3. **Startup Innovations**: Startups like Qevlar, HoneyHive, Solve Intelligence, and Delos have collectively raised nearly $36 million to develop agentic AI solutions in cybersecurity, AI agent testing, intellectual property patenting, and office productivity tasks.\\n4. **Microsoft**: Through its Copilot suite, Microsoft is integrating agentic workflows into Excel, Teams, and Power Platform, allowing users to automate project timelines, budget forecasts, and compliance tasks with minimal input.\\n5. **OpenAI**: With tools like *AutoGPT* and ongoing enhancements in *GPT-Enterprise*, OpenAI is enabling agentic capabilities such as long-term memory, goal tracking, and autonomous research loops.\\n\\nEnterprises piloting agentic workflows report:\\n\\n* 30–50% gains in process efficiency and throughput.\\n* 20–30% faster decision cycles in finance, HR, and supply-chain functions.\\n* Average 40% reduction in routine labor costs across service-desk and back-office operations.\\n* Capgemini finds organizations embedding Agentic AI see up to 25% increase in customer-experience scores\\n\\n### 5 Emerging Trends in Agentic AI\\n\\n* **Edge & Federated Agentic AI:** Autonomous agents are moving out of the data center to run directly on edge devices (phones, IoT sensors) while using federated learning to stay up-to-date and privacy-preserving.\\n* **Low-Code/No-Code Orchestration Platforms:** Citizen developers can now assemble and govern AI agents via drag-and-drop interfaces in enterprise LCAPs, slashing time-to-value and embedding compliance guardrails by default.\\n* **Hybrid AI Routers & On-Device “Super Agents”:** New frameworks dynamically route tasks between compact on-device models and cloud LLMs, enabling “super agents” that optimize for latency, cost, and privacy in real time.\\n* **Multi-Agent Marketplaces & Collaboration Frameworks:** Platforms akin to app-stores are emerging where organizations can license, share, or co-develop specialized agents—spawning vibrant ecosystems of interoperable AI workflows.\\n* **Vertical, Domain-Specialized Agents:** The next wave focuses on industry-tailored agents (e.g., legal-review bots, medical-triage assistants) built with embedded domain knowledge and compliance rules for higher accuracy and trustworthiness.\\n\\n### Challenges and Ethical Considerations\\n\\nAs enterprises grant agents greater autonomy, robust oversight becomes imperative. Gartner highlights “AI Governance Platforms” as a critical trend in 2025, providing policy enforcement, audit trails, and role-based access control for autonomous systems.\\xa0Harvard Business Review cautions that without such guardrails, “machines at scale can amplify errors faster than humans can catch them” and urges cross-functional governance committees to oversee agent deployments.\\xa0Deloitte emphasizes the need for “guardian agents”—secondary agents that continuously monitor primary agent behavior and intervene when actions deviate from defined ethical or operational boundaries.\\n\\n### Future Outlook\\n\\nLooking ahead, IDC predicts global enterprise spending on AI infrastructure and services will exceed USD 30 billion by 2027, underpinning the next wave of agentic innovations. Gartner forecasts that by decade’s end, hybrid human-agent teams will co-manage 40 percent of routine enterprise processes, blending AI’s speed with human judgment. Harvard Business Review sums it up: “Humans with AI will replace humans without AI,” signaling a workforce transformation driven by autonomous collaborators. For organizations that embrace these agents responsibly—investing in technical foundations, governance frameworks, and continuous learning—the promise is unprecedented efficiency, innovation, and competitive differentiation in the autonomous enterprise era.\\n\\n[Connectech.](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/connectech-7006461116750934016)\\n![Connectech.]()\\n\\n### Connectech.\\n\\n####

You can find agentic AI examples in all industries, and use cases are expanding.\\n\\nCompanies are adopting these systems despite implementation challenges and inherent risks. According to [a 2025 Gravitee survey](https://www.morningstar.com/news/globe-newswire/9441117/governance-is-the-top-priority-for-companies-using-agentic-ai-systems), approximately 72% of medium-sized companies and large enterprises currently use agentic AI, and an additional 21% plan to adopt it within the next two years. The global market is predicted to grow from $5.2 billion in 2024 to [$196.6 billion in 2034](https://market.us/report/agentic-ai-market/#utm_source=chatgpt.com).\\n\\nShould you embrace this technology now or wait until it matures? Our article breaks down current real-life agentic AI use cases and shows how the technology can benefit companies.\\n\\n## What is agentic AI?\\n\\nAgentic AI is a semi-autonomous, self-learning, and deterministic system capable of handling complex tasks. It can learn from past interactions, make real-time decisions, plan execution, adjust behavior based on real-time data, and coordinate other tools and APIs.\\n\\nHere’s how it works: first, you assign an objective and establish constraints (rules). Agentic AI then interprets your goals, breaks them into subtasks, and plans how to accomplish all the tasks. The system uses third-party apps and databases, adjusts execution of its plan based on output, and studies the results to learn from mistakes.\\n\\nYou can learn more about the [technologies behind agentic AI workflows](https://devcom.com/tech-blog/ai-agentic-workflows/) in our in-depth guide.\\n\\n## Why are agentic workflows and AI agents important?\\n\\nBusinesses prefer agentic AI over traditional rule-based automation and fully autonomous agents for several reasons:\\n\\n* ![icon](data:image/svg+xml... \"Agentic AI for Businesses in 2025: <br/>Examples, Use Cases & Benefits 2\")![icon](/wp-content/uploads/theme-images/icons/icon-done-done.svg \"Agentic AI for Businesses in 2025: <br/>Examples, Use Cases & Benefits 2\") AI can handle business-critical processes that span multiple teams, tools, and decision layers.\\n* ![icon](data:image/svg+xml... \"Agentic AI for Businesses in 2025: <br/>Examples, Use Cases & Benefits 2\")![icon](/wp-content/uploads/theme-images/icons/icon-done-done.svg \"Agentic AI for Businesses in 2025: <br/>Examples, Use Cases & Benefits 2\") AI agents assist human employees by retrieving and interpreting data or notifying teams about anomalies.\\n* ![icon](data:image/svg+xml... \"Agentic AI for Businesses in 2025: <br/>Examples, Use Cases & Benefits 2\")![icon](/wp-content/uploads/theme-images/icons/icon-done-done.svg \"Agentic AI for Businesses in 2025: <br/>Examples, Use Cases & Benefits 2\") Agentic AI workflows constantly check conditions, adapt to tasks, and escalate to a human when their judgment is required.\\n* ![icon](data:image/svg+xml... \"Agentic AI for Businesses in 2025: <br/>Examples, Use Cases & Benefits 2\")![icon](/wp-content/uploads/theme-images/icons/icon-done-done.svg \"Agentic AI for Businesses in 2025: <br/>Examples, Use Cases & Benefits 2\") Agentic AI operates within strictly defined boundaries, and its decisions remain auditable, whereas autonomous AI agents act with fewer constraints and control.\\n\\nNow that you have a general answer to the question “What is an Agentic AI?” let’s look at some examples to help you truly understand.\\n\\n## Top agentic AI examples and use cases\\n\\nWhat are some real-world applications of agentic AI that your company can potentially implement now? Let’s look at some key examples in different sectors.\\n\\n### 1. Finance\\n\\nAgentic AI introduces multistep workflows that continuously analyze high-velocity financial data. Use cases for agentic AI in financial organizations include adjusting credit scores, automating Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, calculating loans, and continuous monitoring of financial health indicators.\\n\\nThe systems can fetch data beyond traditional sources, including customer relationship management (CRM) systems, payment gateways, banking data, credit bureaus, and sanction databases. Moreover, agentic AI can cross-reference entity names, addresses, and social media platforms to expose shell companies and individuals tied to sanctioned actors.\\n\\nAgentic systems can learn more about customers from behavior signals than traditional AI applications, including information about transactions, income, and purchases. When a transaction deviates from a typical pattern, it can trigger additional checks on activity. At the same time, the model continuously learns from customer responses and the security team’s input.\\n\\n#### Examples:\\n\\n* [PayPal](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2025-04-29-PayPal-Brings-Together-Developers%2C-AI-Leaders-to-Power-Agentic-Commerce-at-Dev-Days) provides AI agents and workflows that handle payments, order tracking, invoicing, product discovery, and fraud prevention.\\n* [Wolters Kluwer’s CCH](https://ibsintelligence.com/ibsi-news/fintech-gets-smarter-finance-leaders-to-6x-agentic-ai-adoption-in-12-months/) agentic AI can test financial assumptions, forecast economic indicators, and simplify complex reports.\\n\\n### 2. Healthcare\\n\\nIn healthcare organizations, real-world applications of agentic AI help manage operational processes and conduct clinical trials. For example, it can update electronic health records (EHRs) based on information from laboratory systems, wearable devices, telehealth visits, and handwritten notes.\\n\\nHospitals use agentic AI to optimize patient flow, schedule patient meetings, predict bed occupancy rates, and manage staff. But use cases extend beyond documentation management and scheduling.\\n\\nAgent-based AI can detect signs of health problems based on data from remote monitoring tools or patient scans. Doctors and nurses use AI to get suggestions on potential diagnoses and treatment options. AI can personalize communications with patients, including educational materials, medication suggestions, and basic motivational support.\\n\\n#### Examples:\\n\\n* [Seattle Children’s Hospital](https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2025-04-07-Seattle-Childrens-Hospital-Partners-with-Google-Cloud-to-Launch-AI-Agent-to-Support-Healthcare-Providers-Clinical-Decision-Making) integrates agentic AI that processes data from CSWs, medical literature, notes, and images to deliver evidence-based clinical information to healthcare providers.\\n* [eClinicalWorks](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/ehrs-and-agentic-ai-balancing-human-and-automated-collaboration) uses agent-based AI that extracts patient data from incoming documents and integrates it with patient records. Another agentic AI example is an agent that answers common patient questions via chat, text, or voice.\\n\\n### 3. Insurance\\n\\nUse cases of agentic AI in the insurance sector include account management, loan processing, and underwriting. If a customer’s policy is about to expire, the system can offer renewals and reschedule billing cycles. Companies can also configure AI to suggest insurance products based on specific rules. For instance, it may recommend (or avoid recommending) insurance depending on the risk of upcoming weather-related flight cancellations.\\n\\nAgentic AI can process insurance claims based on information in emails, telephone calls, handwritten notes, and images. It processes the data, verifies it against the customer’s policy terms, and cross-references for prior claims and suspicious activity, like photo metadata inconsistencies or unusual submission patterns.\\n\\nThese systems don’t necessarily rely on static risk models or prefilled applications for assessment. They can pull signals from satellite imagery, telematics, biometric data from health apps, and regional crime trends. For example, an agentic AI system may adjust vehicle insurance or life insurance costs based on the frequency of speeding tickets.\\n\\n#### Examples:\\n\\n* [LTIMindtree and Boomi](https://siliconangle.com/2025/05/15/boomi-ltimindtree-agentic-ai-solutions-boomiworld/) are working on [agentic AI systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC5O1PhpT_A) for claims processing, vehicle damage assessment, and customer service automation.\\n* [Counterpart](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250312842558/en/Counterpart-Introduces-Agentic-Insurance-Pioneering-AI-Powered-Management-and-Professional-Liability-Systems) rolled out an agentic AI insurance platform that performs underwriting, risk mitigation, and claims management.\\n* [Allianz Partners USA](https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Travel-Agent-Issues/Allianz-integrates-AI-insurance-claims) uses AI agents for claims processing and customer support.\\n\\n### 4. Retail\\n\\nAI agents allow companies to adjust pricing in response to moment-to-moment variables, such as demand signals, competitor pricing, and local events. Other use cases of agentic AI in retail include having it make operational decisions about things like inventory supply projections, warehouse transfers, and order allocations.\\n\\nLet’s say a customer on your website abandons a cart. Rather than triggering basic scripts, agentic AI can detect the reason for abandonment and craft a multistep sequence across channels. For instance, if a user abandoned the purchase on the shipping selection page, the AI agent may send a follow-up email offering local pickup options. For high-value customers, the AI agent might alert a human representative to make contact or trigger a loyalty reward.\\n\\nOn websites, AI agents can personalize suggestions and discounts based on page visits, bounce rates, and clicks. If users interact with a page only briefly, the AI agent can trigger a time-limited discount. In physical stores, if IoT sensors show decreased customer engagement with certain products or areas of the store, a system might suggest rearranging featured products.\\n\\n#### Examples:\\n\\n* [Walmart](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2025/05/29/inside-walmarts-strategy-for-building-an-agentic-future) designs generative agentic AI for various retail workflows, such as displaying item comparisons and recommendations, and offering shopping assistants (personal agents) to website visitors. Other agentic AI use cases at Walmart include planning [pricing strategy and inventory optimization](https://ctomagazine.com/walmart-uses-ai-to-make-shopping-better-for-millions/).\\n\\n### 5. Supply chain management and logistics\\n\\nCompanies usually implement a significant degree of automation, predictive maintenance, and other AI-powered tools. Agentic AI can execute decisions semi-autonomously across the entire supply chain with few manual interventions.\\n\\nFor example, where traditional AI can forecast demand and flag problems, an agentic system can reroute shipments, reissue delivery times, inform all affected parties, and, with enough rights, approve new routes. It can analyze why a specific inventory dip happened and suggest remediation options based on risks, customer impact, vendor agreements, and historical error rates.\\n\\nA good example of agentic AI is its ability to orchestrate multiple tools. If a company has a separate logistical application for fleet routing, one for warehouse slotting, and another for vehicle management, an AI agent can optimize logistics workflows across all those applications.\\n\\n#### Examples:\\n\\n* [Amazon’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgyecRkMnzw) agentic generative AI improves last-mile delivery routes, which saves them up to $100 million annually.\\n* [DHL’s](https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/publications/documents/2024/agentic-ai-the-new-frontier-in-genai-an-executive-playbook.pdf) agentic system predicts shipping demand, optimizes routes, and controls warehousing operations, saving up to 15% on operational costs.\\n\\n### 6. Manufacturing\\n\\nIn many factories, software generates threshold-based alerts by analyzing telemetry data from PLCs, SCADA, and MES. But they often have management systems that create silos because of fragmented tech stacks. Agentic AI can manage the different tech stacks to accomplish multifaceted tasks.\\n\\nFor example, if a CNC machine’s torque readings deviate from its baseline, the system may reduce feed rates, reassign tasks to other machines, trigger an inspection, reschedule affected jobs, and suggest ordering replacement parts.\\n\\nRule-based systems and hardcoded production sequences that rely on static patterns can struggle in high-variability, low-volume (HMLV) environments that produce a wide range of products. However, agentic AI adapts to product design changes, finds component alternatives, and reoptimizes workloads if a machine fails.\\n\\n#### Examples:\\n\\n* [Siemens](https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/publications/documents/2024/agentic-ai-the-new-frontier-in-genai-an-executive-playbook.pdf) AI models analyze IoT data to monitor equipment health and predict machinery failures proactively.\\n\\n### 7. Legal services\\n\\nMany time-consuming legal tasks can be simplified with AI agents and workflows. Examples of agentic AI in practice include analyzing contacts, tracking obligations and deadlines, summarizing complex documentation, and assessing risk. The agentic AI system can identify gaps, contract expiration or renewal terms, as well as differences across vendor templates.\\n\\n[Agentic AI can automate many due diligence processes](https://devcom.com/tech-blog/it-due-diligence-for-ma-technology-audit-guide-checklist/). In addition to internal documentation, it can cross-reference clause libraries, detect terminology deviations, highlight missing provisions, and flag intellectual property issues. Advanced systems can evaluate a company’s infrastructure and technical readiness, codebase quality, security and privacy tools, and human resources.\\n\\nAgentic systems with generative AI capabilities can draft contracts, cease and desist letters, claims, NDAs, and more. Some can even generate multiple versions based on tone, legal positioning, and urgency. While legal specialists still verify the documents, AI reduces drafting time.\\n\\n#### Examples:\\n\\n* [JPMorgan’s platform](https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/publications/documents/2024/agentic-ai-the-new-frontier-in-genai-an-executive-playbook.pdf) extracts data points from legal documents, tables, and images, saving over 360,000 hours of manual review every year.\\n* [Hogan Lovells](https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/publications/documents/2024/agentic-ai-the-new-frontier-in-genai-an-executive-playbook.pdf) uses agentic AI to analyze volumes of contracts and sensitive documents, increasing document review speed by 40%.\\n\\n### 8. Farming and agriculture\\n\\nAgentic AI business use cases in agriculture include precision crop management. An agentic AI system can continuously ingest data (from sensors, satellite images, weather stations, analytical platforms, etc.) to directly optimize a system of irrigation controllers, fertilizer injectors, field drones, and other components.\\n\\nIf a heatwave is forecasted, the AI system may suggest an earlier harvest window, reschedule equipment dispatching, and alert operators. Monitoring real-time variables and executing decisions to manage these components improves sustainability targets and minimizes waste.\\n\\nIn livestock management, agentic systems can handle complex scenarios by controlling multiple tools to optimize feeding, medication, and herd control. For example, if animals show signs of illness (indicated by sensors that document reduced feed intake, temperature drop, or irregular movement), the AI system can isolate animals via automated gates, adjust their feeding regimen, and alert the veterinary team with a summary of observed deviations.\\n\\n#### Examples:\\n\\n* [John Deere See & Spray](https://www.vktr.com/ai-technology/the-ai-revolution-part-2-why-reinventing-your-business-beats-optimizing-it/) uses advanced vision systems and agentic workflows to distinguish crops from weeds, reportedly [saving 70% on contact chemicals](https://x.com/tyler_gillett/status/1654481162822189057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1654481162822189057%7Ctwgr%5Ec3c2c25b6d906cec955142e347af955229f1335c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vktr.com%2Fai-technology%2Fthe-ai-revolution-part-2-why-reinventing-your-business-beats-optimizing-it%2F).\\n* [IBM’s Maximo](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/malcolm-adams/2025/05/22/agentic-ai-meets-maximo-the-future-of-agribusiness) is an asset management system that can manage greenhouses, track irrigation system components, optimize equipment performance, suggest lower-emission strategies for machinery, and more.\\n\\n### 9. Software development and IT\\n\\nCompanies can speed up IT operations and software lifecycle with agent-based systems. Some real-world examples of agentic AI include adaptive IT service management systems that continuously monitor infrastructure telemetry and investigate underlying issues. Depending on the rules, the AI system can propose and execute corrective actions.\\n\\nAgentic AI can identify and mitigate cyber threats without waiting for human intervention. Agentic systems are more sophisticated than traditional signature-based detection tools because they can learn from previous incidents, recognize intent patterns, and proactively block threats.\\n\\nAgentic AI assistants integrated into software development can generate boilerplate code, refactor syntax according to guidelines, and debug runtime issues. In DevOps, they can parse CI/CD logs, detect regressions, identify configuration mismatches, and point out security vulnerabilities.\\n\\n#### Examples:\\n\\n* [Amazon’s agentic AI, Transform,](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/migration-and-modernization/aws-transform-generally-available/)  can automate refactoring and migration tasks across environments, help decompose legacy systems, rewrite code, optimize networks, and coordinate transformation plans.\\n\\n### 10. Customer support\\n\\nAutonomous customer service agents are quite common examples of agentic AI systems that are employed across the industries we mentioned above.\\n\\nThese systems assess customer queries and autonomously resolve tickets. Unlike virtual assistants and chatbots, agentic AI can invoke more databases, maintain longer contextual windows, and use current and past interactions to personalize responses.\\n\\n## Benefits and risks of agentic AI\\n\\nThe examples of agentic AI applications we discussed enable your systems to make data-driven decisions faster. This can enhance many aspects of your company, but it can also introduce risks.\\n\\n| Benefits | Risks and limitations |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **Autonomous decision-making:** Agentic systems enable real-time data processing to make immediate decisions (adjust prices, manage inventory, flag incidents, etc.). | **Transparency issues:** Black-box algorithms that can’t explain their decisions are difficult to audit and may not be suitable for certain industries (like healthcare). |\\n| **Enhanced collaboration:** Agentic AI can coordinate actions, tools, and insights across platforms and departments, making an organization more contextually aware and responsive. | **Accountability challenges:** Errors by an autonomous system in sensitive contexts (for example, loan approvals and medical diagnosis) can trigger legal disputes, reputation harm, health risks, and regulatory scrutiny. |\\n| **Higher productivity:** AI can take over administrative work, analytical activities, and complex tasks so employees can shift their focus to other high-value work. | **Excessive reliance:** Overreliance on automation can erode employees’ critical thinking capabilities, particularly in scenarios that depend on human judgment. |\\n| **Improved customer interaction:** Customers benefit from immediate, personalized, and context-aware responses. | **Potential customer problems:** Without clear rules for human oversight and regular performance reviews, agentic AI can mishandle requests and frustrate customers. |\\n| **Consistent compliance:** Enforcement of regulatory laws and corporate rules across operations is a major agentic AI use case, especially in heavily regulated industries. | **Governance complexity:** Lack of clear data policies, mishandled permissions, and poorly configured security mechanisms can lead to compliance breaches, expensive data leaks, and fines. |\\n| **Reduced operational costs:** Agentic workflows that automate mission-critical and routine tasks help cut operational overhead and staff headcount. | **Implementation issues:** Agentic AI may require optimizing infrastructure, standardizing data, coordinating between stakeholders, and lengthy piloting. |\\n| **Operational scalability:** Agentic systems scale up and down based on workloads and customer demand. | **Degraded performance:** Without regular recalibration and training, agentic AI technologies can drift from predefined constraints, compromising accuracy and generating biased outputs. |\\n\\nThere will certainly be more diverse agentic AI examples after 2025, so the advantages and challenges may look different in the future.\\n\\n## Future outlook: What’s next for agentic AI?\\n\\nAgentic AI industry use cases expand every year as the technology evolves. It’s important to consider where it’s heading and what challenges to expect.\\n\\n* **➤ Agentic AI as a competitive edge.** Given the fact that 93% of professionals surveyed by [Gravitee](https://www.morningstar.com/news/globe-newswire/9441117/governance-is-the-top-priority-for-companies-using-agentic-ai-systems) either actively use or plan to implement agentic AI to automate tasks, reduce overhead, and improve customer experience, organizations that ignore this technology may fall behind their future-looking competitors.\\n* **➤ Mass resolution of customer service issues.** According to [Gartner’s 2025 article](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-03-05-gartner-predicts-agentic-ai-will-autonomously-resolve-80-percent-of-common-customer-service-issues-without-human-intervention-by-20290), agentic AI is expected to resolve 80% of user issues without human assistance by 2029. It may reduce the support costs by 30% and completely redefine the customer experience.\\n* **➤ Integration with edge computing.** [Edge computing](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/03/07/the-future-of-field-services-ai-agents-edge-computing-and-5g/) brings computation closer to data sources by processing it locally, rather than sending all data from IoT devices and apps to distant cloud servers. We expect more companies that require fast responses to adopt this technology to reduce latency in field service operations and to enable the function of devices at remote sites with limited connectivity.\\n* **➤ Priority on trust.** According to [Salesforce’s 2024 State of the AI-Connected Customer report](https://www.salesforce.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/documents/research/State-of-the-Connected-Customer.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), users have more trust in AI systems with transparent algorithms (42%), greater control (32%), and explainable outputs (31%). These factors will become critical features for future agentic AI systems.\\n* **➤ Emphasis on regulatory compliance.** [The European Union’s AI Act](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agentic-ai-compliance-eu-act-global-privacy-laws-robert-healey--ai4vc/) classifies agentic AI as high-risk systems that require clear oversight and full assessments for compliance with the act. This means organizations will have to document data sources, ensure models are trained on appropriate datasets (e.g., in terms of size, bias, and compliance with privacy and other regulations), embed interpretable (explainable) models, and conduct external audits to validate their systems.\\n\\nIf you’re serious about implementing agentic AI, you need to build modular, upgradable systems. And if you lack internal skills for that, we recommend [partnering with experienced developers](https://devcom.com/expertise/artificial-intelligence-development-services/).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nCompanies that understand how to use agentic AI can unlock new levels of productivity, control, and customer service. But understanding the use cases doesn’t mean you can build an accurate model on your own that aligns with your business.\\n\\nYou’ll need AI models tuned to avoid bias, trained on your operational data, and maintained for accuracy, among other things. This requires expertise that many teams lack.\\n\\nDevCom can build purpose-driven, explainable  [agent-based AI systems](https://devcom.com/expertise/ai-agent-development-company/) that integrate into your stack and fit with your workflows.\\n\\n## FAQ on Agentic AI\\n\\n### 1.

The independent systems automatically respond to conditions, to produce process results. The field is closely linked to agentic automation, also known as agent-based process management systems, when applied to process automation. Applications include [software development](/wiki/Software_development \"Software development\"), [customer support](/wiki/Customer_support \"Customer support\"), [cybersecurity](/wiki/Cybersecurity \"Cybersecurity\") and [business intelligence](/wiki/Business_intelligence \"Business intelligence\").\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Overview\")]\\n\\nThe core concept of agentic AI is the use of *AI agents* to perform automated tasks but without human intervention.[[1]](#cite_note-WE-1) While [robotic process automation](/wiki/Robotic_process_automation \"Robotic process automation\") (RPA) and AI agents can be programmed to automate specific tasks or support rule-based decisions, the rules are usually fixed.[[2]](#cite_note-BB-2) Agentic AI operates independently, making decisions through continuous learning and analysis of external data and complex data sets.[[3]](#cite_note-NB-3) Functioning agents can require various AI techniques, such as [natural language processing](/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\"), [machine learning](/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") (ML), and [computer vision](/wiki/Computer_vision \"Computer vision\"), depending on the environment.[[1]](#cite_note-WE-1)\\n\\nParticularly, [reinforcement learning](/wiki/Reinforcement_learning \"Reinforcement learning\") (RL) is essential in assisting agentic AI in making self-directed choices by supporting agents in learning best actions through the trial-and-error method. Agents using RL continuously to explore their surroundings will be given rewards or punishment for their actions, which refines their decision-making capability over time. All the while [deep learning](/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\"), as opposed to [rule-based](/wiki/Rule-based_system \"Rule-based system\") methods, supports agentic AI through multi-layered neural networks to learn features from extensive and complex sets of data. Further, [multimodal learning](/wiki/Multimodal_learning \"Multimodal learning\") enable AI agents to integrate various types of information, such as text, images, audio and video [[4]](#cite_note-:0-4). As a result, agentic AI systems are capable of making independent decisions, interacting with their environment and optimising processes without a human directly intervening[[4]](#cite_note-:0-4).\\n\\n## History\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: History\")]\\n\\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Measuring_AI_Ability_to_Complete_Long_Tasks.png/250px-Measuring_AI_Ability_to_Complete_Long_Tasks.png)](/wiki/File%3AMeasuring_AI_Ability_to_Complete_Long_Tasks.png)\\n\\nGraph from the nonprofit [METR](/wiki/METR \"METR\") showing that the length of tasks [frontier models](/wiki/Frontier_model \"Frontier model\") are capable of executing at a 50% success rate has roughly doubled every 7 months from 2019 to 2024. The shaded region represents the 95% [confidence interval](/wiki/Confidence_interval \"Confidence interval\").[[5]](#cite_note-5)\\n\\nSome scholars trace the conceptual roots of agentic AI to [Alan Turing](/wiki/Alan_Turing \"Alan Turing\")\\'s mid-20th century work with machine intelligence and [Norbert Wiener](/wiki/Norbert_Wiener \"Norbert Wiener\")\\'s work on feedback systems.[[6]](#cite_note-CR-6) The term agent-based process management system was used as far back as 1998 to describe the concept of using autonomous agents for business process management.[[7]](#cite_note-7) The psychological principle of agency was also discussed in the 2008 work of sociologist [Albert Bandura](/wiki/Albert_Bandura \"Albert Bandura\"), who studied how humans can shape their environments.[[8]](#cite_note-8) This research would shape how humans modeled and developed artificial intelligence agents.[[9]](#cite_note-9)\\n\\nSome additional milestones of agentic AI include [IBM](/wiki/IBM \"IBM\")\\'s [Deep Blue](/wiki/Deep_Blue_%28chess_computer%29 \"Deep Blue (chess computer)\"), demonstrating how agency could work within a confined domain, advances in machine learning in the 2000s, AI being integrated into robotics, and the rise of generative AI such as [OpenAI](/wiki/OpenAI \"OpenAI\")\\'s [GPT models](/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer \"Generative pre-trained transformer\") and [Salesforce](/wiki/Salesforce \"Salesforce\")\\'s Agentforce platform.[[6]](#cite_note-CR-6)[[10]](#cite_note-10)\\n\\nIn the last decade, significant advances in AI have spurred the development of agentic AI. Breakthroughs in [deep learning](/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\"), [reinforcement learning](/wiki/Reinforcement_learning \"Reinforcement learning\"), and [neural networks](/wiki/Neural_networks \"Neural networks\") allowed AI systems to learn on their own and make decision with minimal human guidance.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACitation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*] Consilience of agentic AI across autonomous transportation, industrial automation, and tailored healthcare has also supported its viability. [Self-driving cars](/wiki/Self-driving_car \"Self-driving car\") use agentic AI to handle complex road scenarios.[[11]](#cite_note-11)\\n\\nIn 2025, research firm [Forrester](/wiki/Forrester_Research \"Forrester Research\") named agentic AI a top [emerging technology](/wiki/Emerging_technology \"Emerging technology\") for 2025.[[12]](#cite_note-UC-12)\\n\\n## Applications\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Applications\")]\\n\\nApplications using agentic AI include:\\n\\n* Software development - [AI coding](/wiki/Vibe_coding \"Vibe coding\") agents can write large pieces of code, and review it. Agents can even perform non-code related tasks such as [reverse engineering](/wiki/Reverse_engineering \"Reverse engineering\") specifications from code.[[12]](#cite_note-UC-12)\\n* Customer support automation - AI agents can improve customer service by improving the ability of [chatbots](/wiki/Chatbots \"Chatbots\") to answer a wider variety of questions, rather than having a limited set of answers pre-programmed by humans.[[12]](#cite_note-UC-12)\\n* Enterprise workflows - AI agents can automatically automate routine tasks by processing pooled data, as opposed to a company needing [APIs](/wiki/API \"API\") preprogrammed for specific tasks.[[12]](#cite_note-UC-12)\\n* Cybersecurity and threat detection - AI agents deployed for [cybersecurity](/wiki/Computer_security \"Computer security\") can automatically detect and mitigate threats in real time. Security responses can also be automated based on the type of threat.[[12]](#cite_note-UC-12)\\n* Business intelligence - AI agents can support [business intelligence](/wiki/Business_intelligence \"Business intelligence\") to produce more useful analytics, such as responding to natural language voice prompts.[[12]](#cite_note-UC-12)\\n* Real-world applications - agentic AI is already being used in many real-world situations to automate complex tasks, across industries, and therefore has been successfully deployed in many departments and organizations. Some of the examples are\\n  + Manufacturing and predictive maintenance - Siemens AG uses agentic AI to analyze real-time sensor data from industrial equipment, predicting failures before they occur. Following the deployment of agentic AI in their operations, they reduced unplanned downtime by 25%.[[13]](#cite_note-13)[[14]](#cite_note-14)\\n  + Finance and algorithmic trading - At JPMorgan & Chase they developed various tools for financial services, one being \"LOXM\" that executes high-frequency trades autonomously, adapting to market volatility faster than human traders.[[15]](#cite_note-15)\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: See also\")]\\n\\n* [Intelligent agent](/wiki/Intelligent_agent \"Intelligent agent\")\\n* [Model Context Protocol](/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol \"Model Context Protocol\")\\n* [Rational agent](/wiki/Rational_agent \"Rational agent\")\\n* [Robotic process automation](/wiki/Robotic_process_automation \"Robotic process automation\")\\n* [Software agent](/wiki/Software_agent \"Software agent\")\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: References\")]\\n\\n1. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-WE_1-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-WE_1-1) Miller, Ron (December 15, 2024).

But success hinges on orchestration, oversight and cultural readiness.\\n\\n![abstract tablet](https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3989217-0-15553600-1747745811-iStock-1849016919.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024)\\n\\nCredit: iStock\\n\\nAn agent, derived from the Latin word *agere* or *agens,* implies something capable of producing an effect when authorized by another. In software, agents commonly refer to programs acting on behalf of a user or another computer program. The concept derives from a model of concurrent computation in the 1970s. With the advent of artificial intelligence, agents also exhibit additional properties such as basic reasoning, autonomy and collaboration.\\n\\nThe emergence of software-based automation over the past few decades has occurred alongside advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. Enterprises have progressively adopted new waves of automation paradigms – from simple scripts and bots to robotic process automation (RPA) and cloud-based automation platforms.\\n\\nToday, agentic AI — software agents that exhibit autonomy, adaptiveness and reasoning — represents the frontier. Yet real-world adoption remains uneven, as we will discuss later. While certain enterprises pilot small-scale “AI assistant” prototypes, others are grappling with how to orchestrate multiple agents across diverse and complex business processes. The recent emergence of agentic protocol frameworks like model context protocol (MCP) from Anthropic and agent to agent (A2A) from Google are trying to address interoperability and integration functionality, which adds another layer to the AI stack.\\n\\nThis paper explores the emergence of agentic AI in the enterprise through three key themes:\\n\\n1. **Core properties** of a true agentic system.\\n2. **Challenges and solutions** for designing semi-autonomous yet robust AI agents.\\n3. **Practical pathways** for integrating agentic AI into existing enterprise environments, particularly those constrained by compliance or legacy systems.\\n\\nWe begin by surveying the essential features of agentic AI, including the original set of characteristics of intelligent agents proposed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. We then explore design and orchestration strategies, discuss human oversight and governance, and outline practical examples to illustrate deployment and scaling.\\n\\n## Defining agentic AI\\n\\nAgentic AI is not just about using prompts or simple chatbots. In the current era of AI, with the availability of large language models (LLMs) and, more recently, large reasoning models (LRMs), AI agents have taken on wider implications and applications. Unlike traditional software that executes predefined instructions, agentic systems make adaptive, autonomous decisions grounded in reasoning.\\u202f They are not limited to being software entities that act to fulfill a specified goal.\\n\\nThe key difference between agentic AI and earlier solutions is their ability for adaptive, autonomous decision-making on top of basic reasoning and autonomy rather than strictly rule-based or human-directed actions typical of pre-AI agents.\\n\\n### 8 pillars of agentic AI\\n\\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon, had proposed a set desired characteristics of agents because they enhance their ability to effectively navigate complex environments and aid decision making.\\n\\n1. **Task-driven**. The agent orients itself around clear, human-directed objectives — e.g., “optimize inventory levels” or “automatically reconcile monthly financial statements.”\\n2. **Network-enabled**. Agents interact with databases, APIs and other agents, forming part of a distributed system.\\n3. **Semi-autonomous**. While agents can initiate actions on their own, they typically require human-defined constraints and human supervision approval, especially in regulated or high-stakes workflows.\\n4. **Persistent**. The agent endures over time, rather than existing only for a single request and action. This persistence underpins the ability to monitor changes and continue functioning without repeated intervention.\\n5. **Reliable**. The agent should perform dependably to the user’s needs, thus engendering trust in its performance.\\n6. **Active**. Beyond passive query handling, an agentic system should be able to monitor its environment and proactively initiate actions/alerts or recommend next actions, even when no human prompt is received.\\n7. **Collaborative**. Agents are designed to work collectively — either with other agents or with humans — coordinating activities such as data sharing, conflict resolution, process handoffs and consensus decision-making. Agents should continually incorporate knowledge from their environment.\\n8. **Adaptive and anticipatory**. Agents can refine their strategies or models, using new data or sources to improve accuracy, efficiency or other user goals, including ones that may not have been originally stated.\\n\\n## Enterprise design and deployment\\n\\nAdopting agentic AI in the enterprise requires addressing a set of architectural and operational challenges from the outset. While agents promise transformative value, they also introduce complexity and risk that must be mitigated by thoughtful design.\\n\\nWe highlight both the risk and complexity of agentic systems with recommendations.\\n\\nAs is common in software abstractions, components bring complexity, be it microservices in the cloud or “too many bots” in RPA. AI agents introduce even more complex layers of interaction and coordination. An enterprise may have a wide variety of user-facing, general-purpose purpose or specialized agents versus specialized agents, even leading up to the next category of developer-facing agents as a service. A version of this capability has emerged in agentic protocol frameworks like MCP and A2A. These frameworks are not dissimilar to middleware in that they provide a means of standardized communication and integration and reusable components in workflows.\\n\\nEnterprise software has benefited from evolving layers of software abstraction in distributed computing over the last few decades. However, the frameworks also present challenges of integration and compatibility across legacy enterprise systems, as seen with middleware (i.e., a complexity tradeoff). That complexity, accompanied by risk and security challenges, requires us to be mindful and design guardrails along many dimensions.\\n\\n### Agent infrastructure\\n\\nThe surge of interest in the deployment of agents needs a rethinking of how agent infrastructure is built. Early in the present AI era, agentic applications were more DIY, but the demands of enterprise software require layers of infrastructure to build and deploy agentic workflows reliably and at scale. A typical agent infrastructure should be a layer cake comprised of:\\n\\n* **Foundational platforms.** Foundation models, multi-agent frameworks and observability layers.\\n* **Orchestration layers.** Systems for routing, agent coordination, state persistence and task management.\\n* **Data services.** Specific to model memory, storage, data extraction, ETL, etc.\\n* **Tooling.** Browser automation, UI integration, service discovery security modules.\\n* Use of **Agentic protocols**. Naming, discovery, standards, etc., in inter-agent communication and interactions have to be well defined.\\n\\nWe will briefly touch upon orchestration and then focus on risk and security guardrails that are needed.\\n\\n### Agent orchestration\\n\\nOrchestration is essential for managing coordination among numerous agents. Common architectures include:\\n\\n* **Hierarchical (hub-and-spoke)**. Centralized control by a “master” or supervisory agent.\\n* **Decentralized (peer-to-peer)**. Agents discover and coordinate through shared protocols.\\n* **Hybrid models**. Most enterprises require a blend of both approaches.\\n\\n### Risk and security\\n\\nAny AI augmented automation will be subject to risks of data misinterpretation, bias, flawed logic, overconfident speculation (collectively referred to as *hallucination*) along with temporal and context errors and malicious attempts such as model or prompt poisoning and traditional cyberattacks.\\n\\nFurther, in highly regulated environments (e.g., HIPAA in healthcare, SOX in finance), companies demand traceability with audit trails. AI agents that autonomously gather and act on data must leave a **digital footprint** for each decision:\\n\\n* **Traceable decision logs**. If an agent rejects an invoice or flags a suspicious claim, logs should clarify *why* it took that action (transparency in their reasoning logic)\\n* **Controlled delegation** that maintains human control over high-stakes decisions while automating low-risk activities to agents.\\n* **Circuit breakers**. To prevent agents from making critical decisions without verification.\\n* **Continuous monitoring and robust error handling,** including making compensating adjustments when detected or through human oversight\\n* **Data governance**. Access control, anonymization strategies and safe harbor approaches help ensure compliance even when agents are cross-referencing multiple data sources.\\n\\n### Agent supervision — Human in the loop\\n\\nWhile greater autonomy can reduce manual work, it also raises questions of safety, security, reliability and ethical oversight. If humans are only asked to intervene in exceptional cases, they may lack context when an alert finally arrives and in critical infrastructure cases context switching is fraught with risk of last minute human intervention.\\n\\nStrategies to address this issue include:\\n\\n* **Periodic “checkpoints” and inserted friction**. Agents pause at specific milestones for human review, especially in risk-sensitive domains like finance or healthcare with vulnerable populations. Additional verification steps can be inserted in those high-stakes use cases.\\n* **Maintaining operator engagement**. A state of flow is essential to human engagement. Just dashboards or notifications that keep operators aware of ongoing tasks, even when no intervention is requested, may not be sufficient. They need to be augmented with training and gaming scenarios that maintain skills, interest and focus in machine-human hybrid workflows.\\n* **Training and cultural awareness**. Protocols are needed for regular training of human operators to keep their AI awareness and skills up to date, incorporate their feedback into error handling and clear awareness of the systems limitations so the operators don’t over-surrender their agency.\\n\\n## Use cases and early lessons learned\\n\\nThese examples describe some cases where agentic AI can automate workflows and augment human effort.\\n\\n1. **Power grid load balancing**\\n\\n* **Scenario**: Agents monitor real-time electricity demand, renewable energy inputs and grid stability across multiple states\\n* **Outcome**: Improvement in grid efficiency, reduction in brownouts and savings through automated load distribution and predictive maintenance.\\n\\n2. **Document reconciliation and processing**\\n\\n* **Scenario**: The agent ingests data from multiple ERP systems, proactively identifying mismatches and can complete forms and correct errors. Humans only intervene in cases or errors not fixable by RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) review.\\n* **Outcome**: Organizations typically see faster closure rates and fewer manual errors, though the agent must integrate with multiple data platforms.\\n\\n3. **Customer support and ticket resolution**\\n\\n* **Scenario**: Agents triage inbound queries, parse them against existing and improving knowledge bases and route complex cases to specialized human reps. Over time, they learn from resolved tickets to improve their handoff accuracy.\\n* **Outcome**: Faster response times, better resolution rates, customer satisfaction metrics — provided a robust *fallback* exists for uncertain queries.\\n\\n4. **Operational monitoring in the supply chain**\\n\\n* **Scenario**: Agents monitor shipment data, predict potential disruptions (weather events, supplier delays) and notify managers proactively.\\n* **Outcome**: Reduced downtime, more agile rescheduling, with *humans in the loop* for final decisions on re-routing or supplier switches.\\n\\n## Key observations\\n\\nIn all the above examples, the need for guardrails, supervision and human judgement is clear. The risk introduced by orchestration gaps can produce conflicting or erroneous results. Even a small error rate in a model can compound rapidly over multiple steps with multiple agents in a complex orchestrated process, as Demis Hassibis of Google Deep recently reiterated. The need for humans in the loop is essential, but without understanding the cognitive load, we put humans under conditions that are prone to make the human-AI hybrid error-prone. Finally, cultural acceptance is key to any automation and Agentic AI is no different. Without employee buy-in and addressing the fear of job loss, the risk of organizational rejection can be significant.\\n\\n## Challenges and future directions\\n\\nWhile small proofs of concept look promising, truly enterprise-wide deployments demand robust infrastructure, standardized toolkits and extensive user training. It is important to distinguish the non-deterministic nature of agents that can take different paths versus traditional rule-based software. Correcting and improving agentic behavior requires many iterations with improved data. In addition, agent infrastructure needs to also incorporate the software practices of lifecycle management, versioning, built-in learning and clearly built governance and compliance rules (especially in applications for regulated industries.\\n\\nCurrent large language (and reasoning) models excel at pattern matching but can struggle with logic or domain constraints. A **neuro-symbolic** hybrid — where a symbolic reasoning module enforces rules or knowledge graphs — could improve agent reliability while still leveraging the adaptive strengths of neural models. LLM/LRM-based agentic systems will perform better with the evolution of true reasoning that is currently lacking.\\n\\nAlready, we see calls for oversight committees and new guidelines around “trustworthy AI.” In industries like healthcare or finance, organizations must expect more stringent external audits, requiring:\\n\\n* **Model transparency, traceability and explainability.** Why did the agent produce this recommendation? Can it document and explain the decision process and be subject to control testing in regulated use cases?\\n* **Compliance-driven fail-safes**. Immediate human review if anomalies exceed a pre-defined threshold.\\n* **Conducting audits.** Defining controls, continuous testing\\n* **Liability frameworks** for agents where there is a formal assignment of responsibility and liability, including potential insurance against agents.\\n* **Code of ethics** and compliance for agent frameworks.\\n* **Quality assurance** standards and testing specific to agent frameworks, including scenario-based stress testing akin to what banks have to conduct in regulatory exams.\\n\\n## Cultivating a culture of readiness\\n\\nAgentic AI represents a transformative leap in enterprise automation, offering capabilities that extend beyond traditional rule-based systems like RPA. Between simple rule-driven use cases and true autonomic intelligent applications, there are a myriad of applications in business. However, successful deployment hinges on more than just sophisticated AI models and agent frameworks. Organizations must cultivate a culture of readiness, characterized by openness to change, robust processes and a balanced approach to risk management. By integrating agentic AI thoughtfully, businesses can unlock new efficiencies and innovation while maintaining ethical and responsible governance. Recommendations include paying attention to and incorporating:\\n\\n* **Robust orchestration**. Avoid “[agent sprawl](https://www.cio.com/article/3987692/new-agentic-ai-tools-bring-new-threat-agent-sprawl.html)” by establishing a comprehensive orchestration layer to manage interactions. Implement “supervisor” agents to ensure seamless coordination and maintain human oversight to mitigate risks associated with autonomous decision-making.\\n* **Adaptive security and data governance**. As agents gain more autonomy over sensitive data, stringent measures such as robust audit trails, security access controls and ongoing compliance checks are essential to ensure regulatory adherence.\\n* **Human oversight and engagement**. Humans must remain an integral part of the process — not just for ethical/regulatory reasons, but to prevent skill atrophy and ensure accountability.\\n* **Iterative scaling**. Start with constrained pilots, carefully measure outcomes and expand. This approach mitigates risk and fosters stakeholder buy-in.\\n* **Ethics and compliance frameworks** with clear guidelines.\\n* **Industry standards**. Not just for data governance and security, but also in agentic capabilities and protocols for integration.\\n\\nUltimately, success with agentic AI depends on a balanced approach incorporating innovation and agility with agentic AI along with organizational readiness — culture, processes, risk tolerance. By honoring these foundational requirements, businesses can tap into the transformational potential of this new era of automation that is both powerful and responsibly governed.\\n\\n**This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network.**\\n[**Want to join?**](https://www.cio.com/expert-contributor-network/)\\n\\n## Related content\\n\\n[Feature\\n\\n### IT leaders find quick wins when adapting cloud strategies to gen AI\\n\\nBy Pat Brans\\n\\nJul 16, 2025 9 mins\\n\\nBudgeting\\n\\nCIO\\n\\nGenerative AI](https://www.cio.com/article/4022010/it-leaders-find-quick-wins-when-adapting-cloud-strategies-to-gen-ai.html)\\n\\n[Opinion\\n\\n### Where silicon meets the springs: Navigating water stewardship in Texas’ AI expansion\\n\\nBy Lauren Spiller\\n\\nJul 14, 2025 9 mins\\n\\nGenerative AI\\n\\nGovernment\\n\\nGreen IT](https://www.cio.com/article/4021037/where-silicon-meets-the-springs-navigating-water-stewardship-in-texas-ai-expansion.html)\\n\\n[News\\n\\n### EU finalizes General-Purpose AI Code of Practice for enterprises\\n\\nBy Peter Sayer\\n\\nJul 10, 2025 3 mins\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence\\n\\nGenerative AI\\n\\nRegulation](https://www.cio.com/article/4020130/eu-finalizes-general-purpose-ai-code-of-practice-for-enterprises.html)\\n\\n[Feature\\n\\n### 3 industries where agentic AI is poised to make its mark\\n\\nBy María Ramos Domínguez\\n\\nJul 4, 2025 9 mins\\n\\nFinancial Services Industry\\n\\nGenerative AI\\n\\nHealthcare Industry](https://www.cio.com/article/4016392/how-agentive-ai-is-making-an-impact-an-industry-by-industry-overview.html)\\n\\n## Other Sections\\n\\n* [PODCASTS](https://www.cio.com/podcasts/)\\n* [VIDEOS](https://www.cio.com/videos/)\\n* [RESOURCES](https://us.resources.cio.com)\\n* [EVENTS](https://www.cio.com/events/)\\n* [Spotlight: AI-ready data centers](https://www.cio.com/it-operations/)\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\\n\\n### From our editors straight to your inbox\\n\\nGet started by entering your email address below.\\n\\nPlease enter a valid email address\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n![Shail Khiyara](https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/920-0-99673700-1748323815-author_photo_Shail-Khiyara_1706226751.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=243)\\n\\nby [Shail Khiyara](https://www.cio.com/profile/shail-khiyara/)\\n\\nContributor\\n\\n1.

            "In 2025, the most buzzed-about evolution in artificial intelligence isn’t just generative—it’s *agentic*. As enterprises shift from passive AI tools to autonomous decision-makers, a new era is dawning: one where AI doesn’t just *assist*—it *acts*. Although academic work on autonomous agents dates back to the late 1990s—when agent-based process management systems first emerged—principles of agency were explored even earlier in social-cognitive theory. The explosive rise of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and leveraging reinforcement learning in 2023–24 catalyzed today’s agentic AI wave, enabling systems to chain multiple LLM prompts, tool calls, and decision logic into cohesive, autonomous workflows.\n",
            "\n",
            "### What is Agentic AI?\n",
            "\n",
            "Agentic AI refers to intelligent systems that can autonomously plan, initiate, and complete complex, multi-step tasks in dynamic environments. These agents are not merely reactive but operate with a sense of *goal-orientation*, continuously learning and adapting from their outcomes. Unlike traditional AI that relies on clear instructions, Agentic AI is designed to think strategically and iteratively, often redefining tasks midstream based on new data or context—very much like a human project manager would.\n",
            "\n",
            "While the broader concepts of autonomous agents have existed for years in robotics and cognitive science, the term “Agentic AI” gained mainstream traction thanks to work from OpenAI, Microsoft Research, and academic circles in 2023–2024. Microsoft’s AI Research blog defines it as “the next stage of generative intelligence—where agents act on your behalf, not just generate responses.”\n",
            "\n",
            "### Current Developments in Agentic AI\n",
            "\n",
            "According to Gartner, by 2026, over 60% of enterprise-level AI applications will feature agentic capabilities, up from less than 10% in 2023. VentureBeat reports a surge in investment: over $2.1 billion was poured into startups building agentic AI solutions in 2024 alone. Platforms like AutoGPT, BabyAGI, and MetaGPT have laid the groundwork, but enterprise-grade systems like OpenAI’s GPT-Enterprise, LangChain, and Microsoft’s Copilot Agents are bringing agentic AI to commercial scale. Notable developments include:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Workday’s Illuminate AI Agents**: Workday has introduced Illuminate AI Agents and an Agent System of Record (ASR) to automate tasks across HR, finance, and planning functions. These agents aim to boost efficiency and reduce overhead costs by automating routine tasks and queries.\n",
            "2. **Johnson & Johnson’s AI Strategy**: Johnson & Johnson has refined its generative AI strategy, focusing on high-value applications such as drug discovery, supply chain management, and internal support tools. Their “Rep Copilot” assists sales reps in engaging healthcare professionals, demonstrating the practical impact of agentic AI.\n",
            "3. **Startup Innovations**: Startups like Qevlar, HoneyHive, Solve Intelligence, and Delos have collectively raised nearly $36 million to develop agentic AI solutions in cybersecurity, AI agent testing, intellectual property patenting, and office productivity tasks.\n",
            "4. **Microsoft**: Through its Copilot suite, Microsoft is integrating agentic workflows into Excel, Teams, and Power Platform, allowing users to automate project timelines, budget forecasts, and compliance tasks with minimal input.\n",
            "5. **OpenAI**: With tools like *AutoGPT* and ongoing enhancements in *GPT-Enterprise*, OpenAI is enabling agentic capabilities such as long-term memory, goal tracking, and autonomous research loops.\n",
            "\n",
            "Enterprises piloting agentic workflows report:\n",
            "\n",
            "* 30–50% gains in process efficiency and throughput.\n",
            "* 20–30% faster decision cycles in finance, HR, and supply-chain functions.\n",
            "* Average 40% reduction in routine labor costs across service-desk and back-office operations.\n",
            "* Capgemini finds organizations embedding Agentic AI see up to 25% increase in customer-experience scores\n",

            "### 5 Emerging Trends in Agentic AI\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Edge & Federated Agentic AI:** Autonomous agents are moving out of the data center to run directly on edge devices (phones, IoT sensors) while using federated learning to stay up-to-date and privacy-preserving.\n",
            "* **Low-Code/No-Code Orchestration Platforms:** Citizen developers can now assemble and govern AI agents via drag-and-drop interfaces in enterprise LCAPs, slashing time-to-value and embedding compliance guardrails by default.\n",
            "* **Hybrid AI Routers & On-Device “Super Agents”:** New frameworks dynamically route tasks between compact on-device models and cloud LLMs, enabling “super agents” that optimize for latency, cost, and privacy in real time.\n",
            "* **Multi-Agent Marketplaces & Collaboration Frameworks:** Platforms akin to app-stores are emerging where organizations can license, share, or co-develop specialized agents—spawning vibrant ecosystems of interoperable AI workflows.\n",
            "* **Vertical, Domain-Specialized Agents:** The next wave focuses on industry-tailored agents (e.g., legal-review bots, medical-triage assistants) built with embedded domain knowledge and compliance rules for higher accuracy and trustworthiness.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Challenges and Ethical Considerations\n",
            "\n",
            "As enterprises grant agents greater autonomy, robust oversight becomes imperative. Gartner highlights “AI Governance Platforms” as a critical trend in 2025, providing policy enforcement, audit trails, and role-based access control for autonomous systems. Harvard Business Review cautions that without such guardrails, “machines at scale can amplify errors faster than humans can catch them” and urges cross-functional governance committees to oversee agent deployments. Deloitte emphasizes the need for “guardian agents”—secondary agents that continuously monitor primary agent behavior and intervene when actions deviate from defined ethical or operational boundaries.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Future Outlook\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking ahead, IDC predicts global enterprise spending on AI infrastructure and services will exceed USD 30 billion by 2027, underpinning the next wave of agentic innovations. Gartner forecasts that by decade’s end, hybrid human-agent teams will co-manage 40 percent of routine enterprise processes, blending AI’s speed with human judgment. Harvard Business Review sums it up: “Humans with AI will replace humans without AI,” signaling a workforce transformation driven by autonomous collaborators. For organizations that embrace these agents responsibly—investing in technical foundations, governance frameworks, and continuous learning—the promise is unprecedented efficiency, innovation, and competitive differentiation in the autonomous enterprise era.\n",

            "\n",
            "Here’s how it works: first, you assign an objective and establish constraints (rules). Agentic AI then interprets your goals, breaks them into subtasks, and plans how to accomplish all the tasks. The system uses third-party apps and databases, adjusts execution of its plan based on output, and studies the results to learn from mistakes.\n",

            "### 1. Finance\n",
            "\n",
            "Agentic AI introduces multistep workflows that continuously analyze high-velocity financial data. Use cases for agentic AI in financial organizations include adjusting credit scores, automating Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, calculating loans, and continuous monitoring of financial health indicators.\n",
            "\n",
            "The systems can fetch data beyond traditional sources, including customer relationship management (CRM) systems, payment gateways, banking data, credit bureaus, and sanction databases. Moreover, agentic AI can cross-reference entity names, addresses, and social media platforms to expose shell companies and individuals tied to sanctioned actors.\n",
            "\n",
            "Agentic systems can learn more about customers from behavior signals than traditional AI applications, including information about transactions, income, and purchases. When a transaction deviates from a typical pattern, it can trigger additional checks on activity. At the same time, the model continuously learns from customer responses and the security team’s input.\n",

For example, it can update electronic health records (EHRs) based on information from laboratory systems, wearable devices, telehealth visits, and handwritten notes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hospitals use agentic AI to optimize patient flow, schedule patient meetings, predict bed occupancy rates, and manage staff. But use cases extend beyond documentation management and scheduling.\n",
            "\n",
            "Agent-based AI can detect signs of health problems based on data from remote monitoring tools or patient scans. Doctors and nurses use AI to get suggestions on potential diagnoses and treatment options. AI can personalize communications with patients, including educational materials, medication suggestions, and basic motivational support.\n",

The independent systems automatically respond to conditions, to produce process results. The field is closely linked to agentic automation, also known as agent-based process management systems, when applied to process automation. Applications include [software development](/wiki/Software_development \"Software development\"), [customer support](/wiki/Customer_support \"Customer support\"), [cybersecurity](/wiki/Cybersecurity \"Cybersecurity\") and [business intelligence](/wiki/Business_intelligence \"Business intelligence\").\n",

            "The core concept of agentic AI is the use of *AI agents* to perform automated tasks but without human intervention.[[1]](#cite_note-WE-1) While [robotic process automation](/wiki/Robotic_process_automation \"Robotic process automation\") (RPA) and AI agents can be programmed to automate specific tasks or support rule-based decisions, the rules are usually fixed.[[2]](#cite_note-BB-2) Agentic AI operates independently, making decisions through continuous learning and analysis of external data and complex data sets.[[3]](#cite_note-NB-3) Functioning agents can require various AI techniques, such as [natural language processing](/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\"), [machine learning](/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") (ML), and [computer vision](/wiki/Computer_vision \"Computer vision\"), depending on the environment.[[1]](#cite_note-WE-1)\n",

Agents using RL continuously to explore their surroundings will be given rewards or punishment for their actions, which refines their decision-making capability over time. All the while [deep learning](/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\"), as opposed to [rule-based](/wiki/Rule-based_system \"Rule-based system\") methods, supports agentic AI through multi-layered neural networks to learn features from extensive and complex sets of data. Further, [multimodal learning](/wiki/Multimodal_learning \"Multimodal learning\") enable AI agents to integrate various types of information, such as text, images, audio and video [[4]](#cite_note-:0-4). As a result, agentic AI systems are capable of making independent decisions, interacting with their environment and optimising processes without a human directly intervening[[4]](#cite_note-:0-4).\n",

            "An agent, derived from the Latin word *agere* or *agens,* implies something capable of producing an effect when authorized by another. In software, agents commonly refer to programs acting on behalf of a user or another computer program. The concept derives from a model of concurrent computation in the 1970s. With the advent of artificial intelligence, agents also exhibit additional properties such as basic reasoning, autonomy and collaboration.\n",
            "\n",
            "The emergence of software-based automation over the past few decades has occurred alongside advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. Enterprises have progressively adopted new waves of automation paradigms – from simple scripts and bots to robotic process automation (RPA) and cloud-based automation platforms.\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, agentic AI — software agents that exhibit autonomy, adaptiveness and reasoning — represents the frontier. Yet real-world adoption remains uneven, as we will discuss later. While certain enterprises pilot small-scale “AI assistant” prototypes, others are grappling with how to orchestrate multiple agents across diverse and complex business processes. The recent emergence of agentic protocol frameworks like model context protocol (MCP) from Anthropic and agent to agent (A2A) from Google are trying to address interoperability and integration functionality, which adds another layer to the AI stack.\n",
            "\n",
            "This paper explores the emergence of agentic AI in the enterprise through three key themes:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Core properties** of a true agentic system.\n",
            "2. **Challenges and solutions** for designing semi-autonomous yet robust AI agents.\n",
            "3. **Practical pathways** for integrating agentic AI into existing enterprise environments, particularly those constrained by compliance or legacy systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "We begin by surveying the essential features of agentic AI, including the original set of characteristics of intelligent agents proposed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. We then explore design and orchestration strategies, discuss human oversight and governance, and outline practical examples to illustrate deployment and scaling.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Defining agentic AI\n",
            "\n",
            "Agentic AI is not just about using prompts or simple chatbots. In the current era of AI, with the availability of large language models (LLMs) and, more recently, large reasoning models (LRMs), AI agents have taken on wider implications and applications. Unlike traditional software that executes predefined instructions, agentic systems make adaptive, autonomous decisions grounded in reasoning.  They are not limited to being software entities that act to fulfill a specified goal.\n",
            "\n",
            "The key difference between agentic AI and earlier solutions is their ability for adaptive, autonomous decision-making on top of basic reasoning and autonomy rather than strictly rule-based or human-directed actions typical of pre-AI agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 8 pillars of agentic AI\n",
            "\n",
            "Researchers at Carnegie Mellon, had proposed a set desired characteristics of agents because they enhance their ability to effectively navigate complex environments and aid decision making.\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Task-driven**. The agent orients itself around clear, human-directed objectives — e.g., “optimize inventory levels” or “automatically reconcile monthly financial statements.”\n",
            "2. **Network-enabled**. Agents interact with databases, APIs and other agents, forming part of a distributed system.\n",
            "3. **Semi-autonomous**. While agents can initiate actions on their own, they typically require human-defined constraints and human supervision approval, especially in regulated or high-stakes workflows.\n",
            "4. **Persistent**. The agent endures over time, rather than existing only for a single request and action. This persistence underpins the ability to monitor changes and continue functioning without repeated intervention.\n",
            "5. **Reliable**. The agent should perform dependably to the user’s needs, thus engendering trust in its performance.\n",
            "6. **Active**. Beyond passive query handling, an agentic system should be able to monitor its environment and proactively initiate actions/alerts or recommend next actions, even when no human prompt is received.\n",
            "7. **Collaborative**. Agents are designed to work collectively — either with other agents or with humans — coordinating activities such as data sharing, conflict resolution, process handoffs and consensus decision-making. Agents should continually incorporate knowledge from their environment.\n",
            "8. **Adaptive and anticipatory**. Agents can refine their strategies or models, using new data or sources to improve accuracy, efficiency or other user goals, including ones that may not have been originally stated.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Enterprise design and deployment\n",
            "\n",
            "Adopting agentic AI in the enterprise requires addressing a set of architectural and operational challenges from the outset. While agents promise transformative value, they also introduce complexity and risk that must be mitigated by thoughtful design.\n",
            "\n",
            "We highlight both the risk and complexity of agentic systems with recommendations.\n",
            "\n",
            "As is common in software abstractions, components bring complexity, be it microservices in the cloud or “too many bots” in RPA. AI agents introduce even more complex layers of interaction and coordination. An enterprise may have a wide variety of user-facing, general-purpose purpose or specialized agents versus specialized agents, even leading up to the next category of developer-facing agents as a service. A version of this capability has emerged in agentic protocol frameworks like MCP and A2A. These frameworks are not dissimilar to middleware in that they provide a means of standardized communication and integration and reusable components in workflows.\n",
            "\n",
            "Enterprise software has benefited from evolving layers of software abstraction in distributed computing over the last few decades. However, the frameworks also present challenges of integration and compatibility across legacy enterprise systems, as seen with middleware (i.e., a complexity tradeoff). That complexity, accompanied by risk and security challenges, requires us to be mindful and design guardrails along many dimensions.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Agent infrastructure\n",
            "\n",
            "The surge of interest in the deployment of agents needs a rethinking of how agent infrastructure is built. Early in the present AI era, agentic applications were more DIY, but the demands of enterprise software require layers of infrastructure to build and deploy agentic workflows reliably and at scale. A typical agent infrastructure should be a layer cake comprised of:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Foundational platforms.** Foundation models, multi-agent frameworks and observability layers.\n",
            "* **Orchestration layers.** Systems for routing, agent coordination, state persistence and task management.\n",
            "* **Data services.** Specific to model memory, storage, data extraction, ETL, etc.\n",
            "* **Tooling.** Browser automation, UI integration, service discovery security modules.\n",
            "* Use of **Agentic protocols**. Naming, discovery, standards, etc., in inter-agent communication and interactions have to be well defined.\n",
            "\n",
            "We will briefly touch upon orchestration and then focus on risk and security guardrails that are needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Agent orchestration\n",
            "\n",
            "Orchestration is essential for managing coordination among numerous agents. Common architectures include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Hierarchical (hub-and-spoke)**. Centralized control by a “master” or supervisory agent.\n",
            "* **Decentralized (peer-to-peer)**. Agents discover and coordinate through shared protocols.\n",
            "* **Hybrid models**. Most enterprises require a blend of both approaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Risk and security\n",
            "\n",
            "Any AI augmented automation will be subject to risks of data misinterpretation, bias, flawed logic, overconfident speculation (collectively referred to as *hallucination*) along with temporal and context errors and malicious attempts such as model or prompt poisoning and traditional cyberattacks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Further, in highly regulated environments (e.g., HIPAA in healthcare, SOX in finance), companies demand traceability with audit trails. AI agents that autonomously gather and act on data must leave a **digital footprint** for each decision:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Traceable decision logs**. If an agent rejects an invoice or flags a suspicious claim, logs should clarify *why* it took that action (transparency in their reasoning logic)\n",
            "* **Controlled delegation** that maintains human control over high-stakes decisions while automating low-risk activities to agents.\n",
            "* **Circuit breakers**. To prevent agents from making critical decisions without verification.\n",
            "* **Continuous monitoring and robust error handling,** including making compensating adjustments when detected or through human oversight\n",
            "* **Data governance**. Access control, anonymization strategies and safe harbor approaches help ensure compliance even when agents are cross-referencing multiple data sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Agent supervision — Human in the loop\n",
            "\n",
            "While greater autonomy can reduce manual work, it also raises questions of safety, security, reliability and ethical oversight. If humans are only asked to intervene in exceptional cases, they may lack context when an alert finally arrives and in critical infrastructure cases context switching is fraught with risk of last minute human intervention.\n",
            "\n",
            "Strategies to address this issue include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Periodic “checkpoints” and inserted friction**. Agents pause at specific milestones for human review, especially in risk-sensitive domains like finance or healthcare with vulnerable populations. Additional verification steps can be inserted in those high-stakes use cases.\n",
            "* **Maintaining operator engagement**. A state of flow is essential to human engagement. Just dashboards or notifications that keep operators aware of ongoing tasks, even when no intervention is requested, may not be sufficient. They need to be augmented with training and gaming scenarios that maintain skills, interest and focus in machine-human hybrid workflows.\n",
            "* **Training and cultural awareness**. Protocols are needed for regular training of human operators to keep their AI awareness and skills up to date, incorporate their feedback into error handling and clear awareness of the systems limitations so the operators don’t over-surrender their agency.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Use cases and early lessons learned\n",
            "\n",
            "These examples describe some cases where agentic AI can automate workflows and augment human effort.\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Power grid load balancing**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Scenario**: Agents monitor real-time electricity demand, renewable energy inputs and grid stability across multiple states\n",
            "* **Outcome**: Improvement in grid efficiency, reduction in brownouts and savings through automated load distribution and predictive maintenance.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Document reconciliation and processing**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Scenario**: The agent ingests data from multiple ERP systems, proactively identifying mismatches and can complete forms and correct errors. Humans only intervene in cases or errors not fixable by RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) review.\n",
            "* **Outcome**: Organizations typically see faster closure rates and fewer manual errors, though the agent must integrate with multiple data platforms.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Customer support and ticket resolution**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Scenario**: Agents triage inbound queries, parse them against existing and improving knowledge bases and route complex cases to specialized human reps. Over time, they learn from resolved tickets to improve their handoff accuracy.\n",
            "* **Outcome**: Faster response times, better resolution rates, customer satisfaction metrics — provided a robust *fallback* exists for uncertain queries.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Operational monitoring in the supply chain**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Scenario**: Agents monitor shipment data, predict potential disruptions (weather events, supplier delays) and notify managers proactively.\n",
            "* **Outcome**: Reduced downtime, more agile rescheduling, with *humans in the loop* for final decisions on re-routing or supplier switches.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Key observations\n",
            "\n",
            "In all the above examples, the need for guardrails, supervision and human judgement is clear. The risk introduced by orchestration gaps can produce conflicting or erroneous results. Even a small error rate in a model can compound rapidly over multiple steps with multiple agents in a complex orchestrated process, as Demis Hassibis of Google Deep recently reiterated. The need for humans in the loop is essential, but without understanding the cognitive load, we put humans under conditions that are prone to make the human-AI hybrid error-prone. Finally, cultural acceptance is key to any automation and Agentic AI is no different. Without employee buy-in and addressing the fear of job loss, the risk of organizational rejection can be significant.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Challenges and future directions\n",
            "\n",
            "While small proofs of concept look promising, truly enterprise-wide deployments demand robust infrastructure, standardized toolkits and extensive user training. It is important to distinguish the non-deterministic nature of agents that can take different paths versus traditional rule-based software. Correcting and improving agentic behavior requires many iterations with improved data. In addition, agent infrastructure needs to also incorporate the software practices of lifecycle management, versioning, built-in learning and clearly built governance and compliance rules (especially in applications for regulated industries.\n",
            "\n",
            "Current large language (and reasoning) models excel at pattern matching but can struggle with logic or domain constraints. A **neuro-symbolic** hybrid — where a symbolic reasoning module enforces rules or knowledge graphs — could improve agent reliability while still leveraging the adaptive strengths of neural models. LLM/LRM-based agentic systems will perform better with the evolution of true reasoning that is currently lacking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Already, we see calls for oversight committees and new guidelines around “trustworthy AI.” In industries like healthcare or finance, organizations must expect more stringent external audits, requiring:\n",

            "Agentic AI represents a transformative leap in enterprise automation, offering capabilities that extend beyond traditional rule-based systems like RPA. Between simple rule-driven use cases and true autonomic intelligent applications, there are a myriad of applications in business. However, successful deployment hinges on more than just sophisticated AI models and agent frameworks. Organizations must cultivate a culture of readiness, characterized by openness to change, robust processes and a balanced approach to risk management. By integrating agentic AI thoughtfully, businesses can unlock new efficiencies and innovation while maintaining ethical and responsible governance. Recommendations include paying attention to and incorporating:\n",
            "\n",

Avoid “[agent sprawl](https://www.cio.com/article/3987692/new-agentic-ai-tools-bring-new-threat-agent-sprawl.html)” by establishing a comprehensive orchestration layer to manage interactions. Implement “supervisor” agents to ensure seamless coordination and maintain human oversight to mitigate risks associated with autonomous decision-making.\n",
            "* **Adaptive security and data governance**. As agents gain more autonomy over sensitive data, stringent measures such as robust audit trails, security access controls and ongoing compliance checks are essential to ensure regulatory adherence.\n",
            "* **Human oversight and engagement**. Humans must remain an integral part of the process — not just for ethical/regulatory reasons, but to prevent skill atrophy and ensure accountability.\n",
            "* **Iterative scaling**. Start with constrained pilots, carefully measure outcomes and expand. This approach mitigates risk and fosters stakeholder buy-in.\n",
            "* **Ethics and compliance frameworks** with clear guidelines.\n",
            "* **Industry standards**. Not just for data governance and security, but also in agentic capabilities and protocols for integration.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately, success with agentic AI depends on a balanced approach incorporating innovation and agility with agentic AI along with organizational readiness — culture, processes, risk tolerance. By honoring these foundational requirements, businesses can tap into the transformational potential of this new era of automation that is both powerful and responsibly governed.\n",
