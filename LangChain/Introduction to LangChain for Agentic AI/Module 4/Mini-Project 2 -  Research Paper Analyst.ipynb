It highlights the need for a structured approach to address these ethical concerns, as current guidelines are still evolving. Through a systematic review of 2,859 articles published between 2013 and 2023, the authors identified gaps in ethical discussions surrounding generative AI applications, especially in text, image, and structured data.
