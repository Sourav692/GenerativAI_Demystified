       "[HumanMessage(content='\\nBased on the following research paper abstract,\\ncreate the summary report of maximum 10 lines\\nfor a general audience\\n\\nAbstract:\\n\\nThe widespread use of ChatGPT and other emerging technology powered by generative\\nartificial intelligence (AI) has drawn much attention to potential ethical issues, especially in\\nhigh-stakes applications such as healthcare.1–3 However, less clear is how to resolve such\\nissues beyond following guidelines and regulations that are still under discussion and\\ndevelopment. On the other hand, other types of generative AI have been used to synthesize\\nimages and other types of data for research and practical purposes, which have resolved some\\nethical issues and exposed other ethical issues,4,5 but such technology is less often the focus\\nof ongoing ethical discussions. Here we highlight gaps in current ethical discussions of\\ngenerative AI via a systematic scoping review of relevant existing research in healthcare, and\\nreduce the gaps by proposing an ethics checklist for comprehensive assessment and\\ntransparent documentation of ethical discussions in generative AI development. While the\\nchecklist can be readily integrated into the current peer review and publication system to\\nenhance generative AI research, it may also be used in broader settings to disclose ethicsrelated considerations in generative AI-powered products (or real-life applications of such\\nproducts) to help users establish reasonable trust in their capabilities.\\n\\nCurrent ethical discussions on generative AI in healthcare\\nWe conducted a systematic scoping review to analyse current ethical discussions on\\ngenerative AI in healthcare. Our search in four major academic research databases for\\nrelevant publications from January 2013 to July 2023 yielded 2859 articles (see Methods for\\ndetailed search strategy and Supplementary Figure S1 for the PRISMA flow diagram), of\\nwhich 193 articles were included for analysis based on application data modality (text, image,\\nor structured data), ethical issues discussed, generative AI involved, and whether generative\\nAI causes or offers technical solutions for issues raised.\\n\\nGenerative AI for text data-based healthcare\\nForty-one of the 193 articles discussed ethical considerations pertaining to generative AI\\napplications for text data, with 20 articles describing methodological developments or\\napplications of generative AI and the other 21 articles describing review-type works on this\\ntopic. Although some of these review-type articles used the general term “generative AI”, the\\nmain body and supporting evidence focused on LLMs. Twenty-nine articles had in-depth\\ndiscussions on ethical issues, whereas the other 12 articles only briefly touched on some\\nethical aspects.\\nAmong the 41 articles, 29 articles focused on discussing ethical issues caused by LLMs (and\\nspecifically by GPT in 16 of the articles), covering a wide range of application scenarios and\\nconsidered the application of all 10 ethical principles identified in the review (see Figure 1),\\nas well as other less discussed concerns such as human-AI interaction, and the rights of\\nLLMs to be considered as co-authors in scientific papers. One paper only commented briefly\\non the need for ethical considerations in LLMs and is summarised in the “Others” category.\\nAlthough all ethical principles are equally important, some are discussed more often than\\nothers, e.g., non-maleficence (also referred to in the literature as ‘benevolence’), equity, and\\nprivacy.\\nFifteen of the 41 articles aimed to resolve some existing ethical issues (for example,\\nconfidentiality of medical data) by using LLMs and other generative AI (e.g., GAN,\\nautoencoder or diffusion), such as, to reduce privacy concerns by generating synthetic\\nmedical text, to reduce disparity by providing accessible services and assistance, to detect\\nhealth-related misinformation, to generate trusted content, and to improve accountability or\\ntransparency over existing approaches. While most articles focused on either identifying\\nethical issues caused by generative AI or proposing generative AI-based solutions, three\\narticles discussed both to provide a more balanced perspective.\\n\\nGenerative AI for image and structured data-based healthcare\\nUnlike the diverse application scenarios of generative AI based on text data, for image and\\nstructured data, this use of generative AI focuses on data synthesis and encryption. Hence the\\nmajority of articles discussed the methodological developments of generative AI as giving\\nrise to a more distinctive and focused set of ethical issues.\\n5\\nNotably, of the 98 articles on image data and 58 articles on structured data, more than half\\n(n=63 for image data and n=33 for structured data) only mentioned ethical considerations as a\\nbrief motivation for methodological developments or as a general discussion point. The rest\\nincluded more in-depth discussions or evaluations of ethical issues. Among these 155 articles\\n(as one article covered multiple modalities), 11 articles were review-type work, where 10\\narticles reviewed methods that mentioned one or two ethical perspectives, and only one\\narticle24 discussed detailed ethical concerns on generative AI applications.\\nResolving privacy issues was the main aim of articles for these two data modalities (n=74 for\\nimage data and n=50 for structured data; see Figure 1), predominantly by generating synthetic\\ndata using GAN. Eight articles on image data and 9 articles on structured data used\\ngenerative AI to reduce bias, e.g., by synthesizing data for under-represented subgroups in\\nexisting databases. For both data modalities, we did not see explicit discussions on resolving\\nautonomy, integrity, or morality issues using generative AI, and for structured data the articles\\nadditionally lacked discussions on trust or transparency.\\nOnly 11 articles for image data selectively discussed some ethical issues that generative AI\\ncan give rise to, without specific discussions regarding autonomy, integrity, or morality. For\\nstructured data, only 4 articles discussed equity, privacy, or data security issues caused by\\ngenerative AI. Only two articles on structured data included both the cause and resolving\\nperspectives by discussing ethical issues that may arise from limitations of methods\\nproposed, specifically bias induced when synthesizing data in order to resolve privacy issues.\\n\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),\n",
