Reduce, reuse, and recycle: Minimize waste by reducing consumption, reusing items, and recycling what can be recycled. This helps decrease the amount of waste that ends up in landfills or incinerators, which can release harmful pollutants into the air, water, and soil.\\n\\n2. Conserve energy: Use energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs, turn off lights when not in use, and adjust thermostats to save energy. Less energy consumption means reduced emissions from power plants, which are a significant source of air pollution.\\n\\n3. Use alternative transportation: Whenever possible, opt for walking, biking, carpooling, or using public transportation instead of driving alone. Vehicles contribute to air pollution, so reducing their usage can make a significant difference.\\n\\n4. Support renewable energy sources: Encourage the transition to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. These sources generate electricity without emitting harmful pollutants or greenhouse gases.\\n\\n5. Limit pesticide and chemical use: Use organic and natural alternatives to pesticides and chemicals whenever feasible. Pesticides and chemicals can contaminate soil and water, harming ecosystems and human health.\\n\\n6. Conserve water: Practice water conservation by fixing leaks, using water-efficient appliances, and reducing water waste. This helps preserve water resources and reduces the amount of wastewater that needs treatment, minimizing water pollution.\\n\\n7. Plant trees and vegetation: Trees and plants help absorb and filter pollutants from the air, improving air quality. Additionally, they prevent soil erosion, reduce water runoff, and provide habitat for wildlife.\\n\\n8. Support environmental policies and organizations: Stay informed about environmental issues and support policies and organizations that promote sustainable practices and pollution reduction.\\n\\nRemember, individual actions alone may not be enough to solve the pollution problem completely. It is also essential to advocate for systemic changes and hold industries and governments accountable for their environmental impact.')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#4.2.1 PromptTemplate\n","\n","from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n","from langchain.llms import OpenAI\n","from langchain.chains import LLMChain\n","\n","prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\" Suggest {number} names for a {domain} startup?\")\n","\n","llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key='')\n","chain = LLMChain(llm=llm,prompt=prompt)\n","\n","print(chain.run({'number':'5','domain':'cooking'}))\n","print(chain.run({'number':'2','domain':'AI'}))"],"metadata":{"id":"cyJHurzOQWFS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#4.2.2 ChatPromptTemplate\n","from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n","from langchain.prompts.chat import (\n","    ChatPromptTemplate,\n","    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,\n","    AIMessagePromptTemplate,\n","    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,\n",")\n","\n","template=\"You are a helful assistant who can gives {category} for given input\"\n","system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)\n","human_template=\"{text}\"\n","\n","human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)\n","chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])\n","chat =  ChatOpenAI()"],"metadata":{"id":"LvIINHMkQ8_y"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["chat(chat_prompt.format_prompt(category=\"antonyms\", text='Rude').to_messages())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"GKVExm8jb9OJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701754395508,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":415,"user":{"displayName":"mehul gupta","userId":"02075325736316345622"}},"outputId":"25b172ba-8041-43d4-ddc3-8aacfd2e65b4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["AIMessage(content='Polite')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":26}]}]}
