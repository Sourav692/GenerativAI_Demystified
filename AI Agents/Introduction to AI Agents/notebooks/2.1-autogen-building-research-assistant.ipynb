This will allow for easy access and verification of the information.\\n\\n3. **Domain Categorization:**\\n   - Clearly define the criteria for categorizing papers into different domains. This will help in maintaining consistency and clarity in the table.\\n\\n4. **Abstract Review:**\\n   - While reviewing abstracts, ensure that the papers specifically focus on applications of LLMs in enhancing or augmenting human learning, rather than just general applications of LLMs.\\n\\n5. **Feedback Loop:**\\n   - Include a feedback loop where the admin can provide comments or request changes after the initial submission of the markdown table.\\n\\nBy addressing these points, the plan will be more robust and ensure the delivery of a comprehensive and verifiable output.', 'name': 'Critic', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'Admin'}, {'content': \"To find papers on LLM applications that enhance or augment human learning from arXiv in the last week, I would follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Search for Relevant Papers:**\\n   - Use arXiv's search functionality to find papers related to LLM applications in human learning.
