      "Page: Microsoft\nSummary: Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology conglomerate headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Founded in 1975, the company became highly influential in the rise of personal computers through software like Windows, and the company has since expanded to Internet services, cloud computing, video gaming and other fields. Microsoft is the largest software maker, one of the most valuable public U.S. companies, and one of the most valuable brands globally.\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. During the 41 years from 1980 to 2021 Microsoft released 9 versions of MS-DOS with a median frequency of 2 years, and 13 versions of Windows with a median frequency of 3 years. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market. Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000.  He oversaw the then-largest of Microsoft's corporate acquisitions in Skype Technologies in 2011, and an increased focus on hardware that led to its first in-house PC line, the Surface, in 2012, and the formation of Microsoft Mobile through Nokia. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has changed focus towards cloud computing, as well as its large acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016. Under Nadella's direction, the company has also expanded its video gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022, which is currently the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue, following the 2023 acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion.\nMicrosoft has been market-dominant in the IBM PC–compatible operating system market and the office software suite market since the 1990s. Its best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems and the Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, which most notably include the Word word processor and Excel spreadsheet editor. Its flagship hardware products are the Surface lineup of personal computers and Xbox video game consoles, the latter of which includes the Xbox network; the company also provides a range of consumer Internet services such as Bing web search, the MSN web portal, the Outlook.com email service and the Microsoft Store. In the enterprise and development fields, Microsoft most notably provides the Azure cloud computing platform, Microsoft SQL Server database software, and Visual Studio.\nMicrosoft is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Meta. In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion. It has been criticized for its monopolistic practices, and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.\n\n\n\nPage: Microsoft Excel\nSummary: Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS and iPadOS. It features calculation or computation capabilities, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Excel forms part of the Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office suites of software and has been developed since 1985.\n\nPage: Microsoft Office\nSummary: Microsoft Office, MS Office, or simply Office, is an office suite and family of client software, server software, and services developed by Microsoft. The first version of the Office suite, announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988 at COMDEX, contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint — all three of which remain core products in Office — and over time Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, Object Linking and Embedding data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand.\nThe suite currently includes a word processor (Word), a spreadsheet program (Excel), a presentation program (PowerPoint), a notetaking program (OneNote), an email client (Outlook) and a file-hosting service client (OneDrive). The Windows version includes a database management system (Access). Office is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the desktop version, available for PCs running the Windows and macOS operating systems, and sold at retail or under volume licensing. Microsoft also maintains mobile apps for Android and iOS, as well as Office on the web, a version of the software that runs within a web browser, which are offered freely.\nSince Office 2013, Microsoft has promoted Office 365 as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the use of the software and other services on a subscription business model, and users receive feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and cloud computing integration that are not necessarily included in the \"on-premises\" releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales. Microsoft also rebranded most of their standard Office 365 editions as \"Microsoft 365\" to reflect their inclusion of features and services beyond the core Microsoft Office suite. Although Microsoft announced that it was to phase out the Microsoft Office brand in favor of Microsoft 365 by 2023, with the name continuing only for legacy product offerings, later that year it reversed this decision and announced Office 2024, which they released in September 2024.\n"

Such machines may be called AIs.\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.

Microsoft Dynamics is a suite of intelligent and cloud-based applications designed to assist in various business operations, including finance, marketing, sales, supply chain management, and customer service. Thereafter, most manufacturers of personal computers licensed MS-DOS as their operating system, generating vast revenues for Microsoft; by the early 1990s, it had sold more than 100 million copies of the program and defeated rival operating systems such as CP/M, which it displaced in the early 1980s, and later IBM OS/2.'},\n",

increased 10% and 11% in constant currency in our largest quarter of the year we again delivered double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses and record commitments to our Microsoft cloud platform commercial booking were significantly ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 19% in constant currency this record commitment quarter was driven by growth in the number of $10 million plus and $100 million plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 and consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $269 billion roughly 40% will be recognized in Revenue in the next 12 months up 18% year-over-year the remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 21% and this quarter our annuity mix was 97% at a company level Activision contributed a net impact of approximately three points to revenue growth was a two-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative 6 Cent impact to earnings per share a reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third party partner to first party and includes 938 million from purchase accounting adjustments integration and transaction related cost FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company Revenue segment level Revenue cogs and operating expense growth Microsoft cloud Revenue was $ 36.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency roughly in line with expectations Microsoft cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 69% in in line with expectations excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure partially offset by Improvement in Azure even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure company gross margin dollars increase 14% And 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decrease slightly year-over-year to 70% excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate gross margin percentage increased slightly even with the impact from purchase accounting adjustments integration and transaction related cost from the Activision acquisition operating expenses increased 13% with nine points from the Activision acquisition at a total company level head count at the end of June was 3% higher than a year ago operating income increased 15% and 16% in constant currency and operating margins were 43% relatively unchanged Eur over year excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate operating margins increased slightly driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline now to our segment results revenue from productivity in business processes was 20.3 billion and grew 11% and 12% in constant currency slightly ahead of expectations driven by better than expected results across all business units office commercial Revenue grew 12% and 1% in constant currency Office 365 commercial Revenue increased 133% and 14% in constant currency with arpo growth primarily from E5 momentum as well as co-pilot for Microsoft 365 paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year with install based expansion across all customer segments seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and Frontline worker offerings although both segments continued to moderate office commercial licensing declined 9% and 7% in constant currency with continued customer shift to Cloud offerings office consumer Revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions was scw 10% to 82.5 million LinkedIn Revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by better than expected performance across all

now represents roughly 90% of total Dynamics Revenue segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly one point year-over-year excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by Office 365 as we scale our AI infrastructure operating expenses increased 5% and operating income increased 12% and 133% in constant currency next the intelligent Cloud segment Revenue was $ 28.5 billion increasing 19% and 20% in constant currency in line with expectations overall server products and cloud services Revenue grew 21% and 22% in constant currency Azure and other cloud services Revenue grew 29% and 30% in constant currency in line with expectations and consistent with Q3 when adjusting for leap year Azure growth included eight points from AI Services where demand remained higher than our available capacity in June we saw slightly lower than expected growth in a few European GEOS in our per user business the Enterprise mobility and Security install base grew 10% to over 281 million seats with continued impact from moderated growth in seats sold outside the Microsoft 365 Suite therefore our Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure in our on premises server business Revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency growth was driven by demand for our hybrid Solutions although was slightly lower than expected transactional purchasing Enterprise and partner Services Revenue decreased 7% on a strong prior year comparable for Enterprise Support Services segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and gross margin percentage decreased roughly two points year-over-year excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure partially offset by the Improvement in Azure noted earlier even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure operating expenses increased 5% and operating income grew 22% in 23 3% in constant currency now to more personal Computing Revenue was $15.9 billion increasing 14% And 15% in constant currency with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition results were above expectations driven by Windows commercial and search the PC market was as expected and windows OEM Revenue increased 4% year-over-year Windows commercial products and cloud services Revenue increased 11% and 12% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to higher in Period Revenue recognition from the mix of contracts devices Revenue decreased 11% and 9% in constant currency roughly in line with expectations as we remain focused on our higher margin premium products while early days we're excited about the recent launch of

revenue increased 44% with 48 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition Xbox content and services Revenue increased 61% slightly ahead of expectations with 58 points of net impact from the

segment gross margin dollars increased 21 1% with 10 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition gross margin percentage increased roughly three points year-over-year primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses operating expenses increased 43% with 41 points from the Activision acquisition operating income increased 5% and 6% in constant currency now back to Total company results Capital expenditures including Finance leases were $19 billion in line with expectations and cash paid for PPN was $13.9 billion cloud and AI related spend represents nearly all of our total Capital expenditures within that roughly half is for infrastructure needs where we continue to build and Lease data centers that will support monetization over the next 15 years and Beyond the remaining cloud and AI related spend is primarily for servers both CPUs and gpus to serve customers based on demand signals for the full year the mix of our cloud and AI related spend was similar to Q4 cash flow from operations was 37.2 billion up 29% driven by strong Cloud Billings and collections free cash flow was $23.3 billion up 18% year-over-year reflecting higher Capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings for the full year cash flow from operations surpassed $100 billion for the first time reaching 9 billion this quarter other income expense was negative $675 million more favorable than anticipated with lower than expected interest expense and higher than expected interest income our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected our effective tax rate was approximately 19% higher than anticipated due to a state tax law signed in June that was effective retroactively and finally we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over 34 billion for the full fiscal year now moving to our Outlook my commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a US dollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise let me start with some ful year commentary for fy2 first FX assuming current rates remain stable we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full year Revenue cogs or operating expense growth next we continue to expect double digigit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering differentiated value for our customers to meet the growing demand signal for our Ai and Cloud products we will scale our infrastructure Investments with fy2 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY 24 as a reminder these expenditures are dependent on demand signals and Adoption of our services that will be managed through the year as scaling these Investments drives growth in cogs we will remain disciplined on operating expense management therefore we expect FY 25 Opex growth to be in the single digits and given our focused commitment to managing at the operating margin level we still expect fy2 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year-over-year and finally we expect our FY 25 effective tax rate to be around 19% now to the outlook for our first quarter based on current rates we expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level Revenue growth by less than one point we expect FX to decrease cogs growth by less than one point and to have no meaningful impact to operating expense growth in commercial bookings increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions should drive Healthy Growth on a growing free base as a reminder larger long-term Azure contracts which are more unpredictable in their timing can derve increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate Microsoft cloud growth margin percentage should be roughly 70% down year-over-year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure we expect Capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand as well as existing AI capacity constraints as a reminder there can be quarterly spend varability from cloud infrastructure build outs and the timing of delivery of Finance leases next to segment guidance in productivity and business processes we expect Revenue to grow between 10 and 11% in constant currency or 20.3 to 20.6 billion US in office commercial Revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and RP gross through E5 and co-pilot for Microsoft 365 we expect office 65 Revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency in our on premises business we expect Revenue to decline in the mid to high teens in office consumer we expect Revenue growth in the low to mid single digits driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions for LinkedIn we expect Revenue growth in the high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses and in Dynamics we expect Revenue growth in the low to mid teams driven by Dynamics 365 for intelligent cloud expect Revenue to grow between 18 and 20% in constant currency or 28.6 to 28.9 billion US doar Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which as a reminder can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and in Period Revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts in Azure we expect Q on Revenue growth to be 28 to 29% in constant currency growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business inclusive of AI which is growing faster than total Azure we expect the consumption Trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the Year this includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non AI growth Trends similar to June growth in our per user business will continue to moderate and in H2 we expect Azure growth to accelerate as our Capital Investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand in our on premises server business we expect Revenue to decline in low single digits as continued hybrid demand will be more than offset by lower transactional purchasing and in Enterprise and partner Services Revenue should decline in the low single digits and more personal Computing we expect Revenue to grow between 9 and 12% in constant currency or 14.9 to 15.3 billion US Windows OEM Revenue growth should be relatively thought roughly in line with the PC market and window those commercial products and cloud services customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security Solutions should drive Revenue growth in the mid single digits as a reminder our quarterly Revenue growth can have variability primarily from in Period Revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts in devices Revenue growth should be in the low to mid single digits search and news advertising X teac Revenue growth should be in the mid to high teens this will be higher than overall search and news advertising Revenue growth which we expect to be in the low single digits and in gaming we expect Revenue growth in the mid-30s including approximately 40 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition we expect Xbox content and services Revenue growth in the low to mid-50s driven by the net impact from the Activision acquisition Hardware Revenue will again decline year-over-year now back to company guidance we expect cogs between 19.95 to 20.15 billion us including approximately 7 $100 million from purchase accounting integration and transaction related cost from the Activision acquisition we expect operating expense of 15.2 to 15.3 billion us including approximately $200 million from purchase accounting integration and transaction related costs from the Activision acquisition other income and expense should be roughly negative $650 million proven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method as interest income will be mostly offset by interest expens as a reminder we are required to recognize gains or losses on our Equity Investments which can increase quarterly volatility we expect our q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19% in closing we remain focused on delivering innovations that matter to our Global customers of every size that Focus extends to delivering on our financial commitments as well we delivered operating margin growth of nearly three points year-over-year even as we accelerate our AI Investments completed the Activision acquisition and had a headwind from the change in useful lives last year so as we begin fy2 we will continue to invest in the cloud and AI opportunity ahead aligned and if needed adjusted to the demand signals we see we are committed to Growing our leadership across our commercial cloud and within that the AI platform and we feel well positioned as we start fy2 with that let's go to Q&A Brett thanks Amy we'll now move over to Q&A out of respect for others on the call we request the participants please only ask one question operator can you please repeat your instruction ladies and gentlemen if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad and a confirmation tone will indicate your lines in the question queue you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys and our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley please proceed excellent uh thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on another uh great quarter and really solid overall fiscal year right now there's a industry debate raging around the um CeX requirements around generative Ai and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that and I think the question for for for you guys from a Microsoft perspective is is uh is capex still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth or do the shifting gross margin profiles change that equation or set another way maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the capex Investments and the yields on those Investments thank you thank you Keith so let me St and then Amy can add to this um I think I would say we primarily start right now from the demand side what I mean by that is um what's the product shape of the product portfolio uh you know what we learned even from the cloud transition which as you know Keith was similar in the sense it was both a knowledge intensive and a capital intensive transition we needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix of I'll call it infrastructure meters as well as SAS applications um so that's the first thing uh that we looking looking at and how is that value Landing with customers and what's the growth rate so when I think about what's happening with M365 co- pilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 Suite uh we have had um the fact that we're getting recurring customers or customers coming back buying more seats or GitHub co-pilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it uh what's happening in the contact center with Dynamics so I would say um you know and obviously the azure uh AI growth that's the first place we look at that then drives bulk of the cap expend basically that's the demand signal uh because you got to remember even in the capital spend there is land and there is data center build but 60 plus percent is the kit uh that only will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal right so that's I think the key way to think about Capital cycle even uh the asset as Amy said is long-term asset uh which is land and the data center which by the way we don't even construct things fully we can even have things which are semi constructiv we called cold shells and so on so we know how to manage our cap expend to build out a long-term asset uh and a lot of the hydration of the kit happens when we have the demand signal there is definitely spend for training uh even there of course we will only be scaling uh training as we see the demand uh crew in any given period in time so I would say it's more important to manage to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that's driving value and on that front I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering whether it's in consumer side uh whether it's in commercial per seed side or on the consumption meters uh that's I think the fundamental driver and Keith you know I do think um and I really do appreciate how you phrase the question as well because I think the timing uh and some of the questions you all have had really led to how we were talking even about Capital expense uh in our comments and my comments today um being able to maybe share a little more about that when we talked about you know roughly half of FY 24's total Capital expense as well as half of q4's um expense it's really on land and builds and finance leases and those things really will be monetized over 15 years and be beond and they're incredibly flexible um because we've built an consistent architecture first with a commercial cloud and second with the Azure stack for AI regardless of whether the demands at the platform layer or at the app layer or through third parties and partners or frankly uh our first party stass it uses the same infrastructure so we've got longli flexible assets and if you think about it that way you can see what we're doing and focused on is building out this network in parallel across the globe because you know when we did this last transition um the first transition to the cloud which seems a long time ago sometimes um it rolled out quite differently we rolled out more Geo by Geo and this one because we have Demand on a global basis we are doing it on a global basis which is important uh we have large customers in every Geo and so hopefully with that um sort of shape of our Capital expense it helps people see how much of that is sort of near-term monetization driver as well as a much longer um duration that's super helpful thank you very much thanks Keith operator next question please and the next question comes from the line of Mark morler with Bernstein research please proceed thank thank you very much uh thank you for Tak the question and congrats on a strong year um gen has been a bit of roller coaster for Tech over the last year with periods of uh acceleration um high expectations and the expectations drop is reality kicked in with Azure growth we've seen this quarter an 0365 commercial not yet fully visible in numbers even though AMU gave us a lot of color on it two quick parts to the question on SAA how should we think about what it's going to take for Gen to become more real across the industry and for it to become more visible within your SAS offerings and Amy um with Cloud it took time for margins to improve it looks like with AI it's happening quicker can you give us a sense of how you think about the margin impact near-term and long term from all the investment on AI thank you yeah thanks again Mark for the question so to me look at the end of the day jna is just software um so it is really translating into uh fundamentally growth on what is been our M365 uh SAS offering uh with a new offering that is the m co-pilot SAS offering which today uh is on a growth rate that's faster than any other previous generation of software uh we launched as a suite in M365 that's I think the best way to describe it I mean and the numbers I think we shared even this quarter are indicative of this Mark so if you look at it uh we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter over quarter that is uh growing 60% right that's a pretty good healthy sign the most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back there that is the same customers with whom we landed the seats coming back and buying more seats and then the number of customers with 10,000 plus seats doubled right it's 2x quarter over quarter that to me is a healthy SAS Core Business and on top of that you know some of the things that Amy shared are on Dynamics that's another exciting uh place for us which is one we're gaining share we're um uh your Dynamics with the Gen builtin is sort of really Biz app is probably the category that gets completely transformed uh with jna contact centers being a great example we ourselves are you know on course to save hundreds of millions of dollars in our own uh customer support and contact center operations I think we we can drive that value uh to our customers and then on the Azure side uh you see the numbers very clearly in fact I think last quarter is when we started giving you that you saw an acceleration of that this quarter uh one of the other pieces Mark is AI doesn't sit on its own right so it's just uh for we have a concept of design wins uh in Azure so in fact uh 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter that's very exciting to us because the most important thing in Azure is to win workloads in the Enterprise uh and that is are starting to happen and these are generational uh things once they get going with you so that's I think how we think about it at least when I look at what's happening on our demand site and Mark to answer the second half of your question on margin Improvement looking different than it did through the last Cloud cycle that's primarily for a reason I've mentioned a couple times we have a consistent uh platform so uh because we're building to one Azure AI stack uh we don't have to have multiple infrastructure Investments we're making one uh we're using that internally first party and that's what we're using with customers to build on as well as isbs so it does in fact um make make margins uh start off better and obviously scale consistently thank you thanks Mark operator next question please the next question comes from the line of cash rangan with Goldman Sachs please proceed I thank you very much and congrats on a great uh year uh fiscal year ending uh question for you Amy when you look at the capex how do you ring efficiencies out of the capex you disclosure at 50% of the was infrastructure the other 50% Tech is very useful so in other words do you have to keep going growing capex at these elevated rates or could you slow down capex and still get that consistent Revenue growth rate in your Azure and generative AI uh that that's the the main question on my mind thank you so much thanks Cash uh that that's a very good question there's really two pieces I think as I heard your question that I would um reflect on the first is could we see sort of consistent Revenue growth without maybe what you would say is more of this sort of elevated um ta expense number or something that continues to accelerate and the answer to that is yes because there's two different pieces right you're seeing half of this go toward long-term builds that Sakia mentioned um you know the pace at which we fill those builds with CPUs or gpus um will be demand driven and so if we see differences in demand signal uh we can throttle that investment on the CPU side which we've done for I guess a long time at this point as I reflect and we'll use all that same learning and demand signal understanding to do the same thing on the GPU side and so um you're right that you could see relatively consistent Revenue patterns and yet see these inconsistencies and and capital spend quarter to quarter the other thing I would um note cash is you'll also notice there's a s of growing distinction between um our capex number and on occas the cash that we pay for PPN and you're going to start to see that more often um in this period um because it happens when we use leases um leases sort of show up all at once and so you'll see a little bit more volatility I've mentioned that in my comments before but I mentioned again just because you're starting to see that distinction in my comments and and hopefully that's helpful context just one other thing Amy if I wanted to add I think as people think about Capital spend I think it's important separate out leases from build and when it comes to build I think it's important for us to think about we think about it in terms of What's the total percentage of cost that goes into each line item land which obviously has a very different duration and a very different lead time so those are the other two considerations we think about lead time and duration of the asset uh land you know Network construction the system or the kit and then the ongoing cost and so if you think about it that way then it you know you know how to even adjust if you will the capital spend based on demand signal thank you it was triggered by the jump and CICS and as Emy pointed out you're guiding to accelerating re Azure Revenue growth rate which I guess follows the the CAPIC search thank you so much once again thanks Cash operator next question please the next question comes from the line of Brent till with Jeff please proceed thanks uh Amy the magnitude to beat this quarter was a little lower than we've seen in the past was there anything unusual on Sal Cycles the close rate that you saw thanks um thanks Brent actually no uh as I was talking on the corner I I mean commercial bookings were much better than we expected going into the quarter um commitments were very good execution across both the core sort of annuity renewal motion um was good as expected the uh larger long-term commitments uh were better than we expected so BR I would not say there was anything really unusual um in how I thought about uh and what we saw in our commercial execution um through through the quarter great thank you thanks Brent operator next question please the next question comes from the line of Carl kierstead with UBS please proceed okay great maybe I'll direct this to Amy Amy I know when you set your Azure guidance you're always looking to uh meet or beat uh the highend the 30% you put up in the June quarter amazing number given the scale of azure but it did come in at the low end of your range and I just love for you to maybe elaborate on on the Delta I guess as I reflect on what you said in your comments there's two things that I heard you say one it sounded like like um there's persistent capacity constraints that you think might uh get alleviated in the second half and then secondly you mentioned perhaps some modest softness in Europe I presume that's uh a little bit more economic rather than Azure specific uh is that the right way to to frame um the performance in the quarter thank you uh thanks Carl um yes that's exactly right maybe I'll just repeat it just so people can hear it uh in my words as well um to that 30 to 31% guide for Q4 and coming in at the lower end at 30 uh you're exactly right the the distinguishing uh between being at the higher end or at the lower end really was um some softness we saw in a few European GEOS on uh non AI consumption um really uh you know made made the difference in that number and and we've assumed that going forward into H1 um inclusive of my guide in 28 to 29 going forward and then let me separate which was your larger point which is what are the other factors you see ongoing um number one you're right uh capacity constraints uh particularly on AI uh and Azure will remained in Q4 and will remain uh in H1 so hopefully hopefully that's helpful yeah thank you Amy thanks Carl operator next question please the next question comes from the line of Brad zelnick with doche bank please proceed great thank you very much Amy with Azure demand once again greater than available capacity I appreciate you know the capex Investments and the buildout and acceleration you expect in the back half but as we think about Cloud capacity and AI Services specifically can you talk about both the near-term and long-term strategy around the AI Partnerships that signing with the likes of Oracle and Cory for example thank you um thanks Brad maybe uh separate a couple of things um we are and we've talked about I think now for quite a few quarters uh we are constrained on AI capacity and because of that actually we've um to your point have signed up with third parties uh to help us uh as we are behind uh with some leases on AI capacity um we've done that with Partners who are happy to help help us extend the Azure platform uh to be able to serve this a Azure AI demand and you do see us uh investing quite a bit as we've talked about in builds so that we can get back in a more balanced Place yeah I mean to me it's no different than leases that we would have done in the past um these you could even say sometimes buying from Oracle maybe even more efficiently because they're even shorter date excellent thanks for the color thanks Brad operator next question please the next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan please proceed thank you very much with a couple quarters of co-pilot for M365 availability under under your belt now how are you assessing the capability of co-pilots to replicate uh the productivity gains that they've created for developers which seem to be very high uh and to do something similar for the broader population of of knowledge workers for instance with you're mentioning the the 10,000 seat deals the repeat purchases is it possible to eventually see co-pilot penetration rates uh equally high in office as they will be in GitHub yeah that's a that's a great question uh in fact the the the GitHub design system uh and the GitHub Co pilot workspace design system which now um you know for example you start with an issue you create a plan from a plan you create a spec um or you create a spec and from a spec you create a plan and then you go uh operate across the full repo uh that's effectively the design system that uh is getting replicated inside of even the uh M365 co-pilot uh and you see this even now uh for examp example you get an email uh you're in sales uh you want to respond to the customer the data from the email is essentially context for a prompt but you expand by bringing in all of your CRM data right so this customer email is in the context of some order all of the CRM record gets completed in context and a reply gets generated uh with the CRM data uh that's the type of stuff that's already happening then you take something like co-pilot Studio you can start even grounding it in more data and then completing workflows so you could say if this email comes from this customer whose order uh date is you know uh got a particular issue with it you can then go and escalate it to somebody else who gets a notification in teams and those are the kinds of workflows that are getting built uh within uh it or by end users themselves uh what used to be line of business applications to us are co-pilot extensions uh going forward so we think of this as uh really a new design system for knowledge and Frontline work to drive productivity uh which would be very akin to what has happened in software engineering so when you think about marketing or Finance or sales or customer service we will effectively replicate uh what you just said which is the type of productivity we've seen in developers uh will come to all of these functions as they think about their work workflow and work artifact all being driven by co-pilots thank you very much thanks Mark operator we have time for one last question and the last question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with Capital markets please proceed hi good evening and thank you for the opportunity to ask the question I actually wanted to Veer towards gaming if I could for a second Xbox content Services Revenue grew 61% 58 points uh help from Activision so net is is about three points of growth how should investors think about the longer term growth potential uh in this area you've made significant Investments including the Activision deal um but how should investors be thinking about the growth potential of the gaming area what are the puts and takes to help make considerations here thank you yeah for us you know our investment um in gaming uh fundamentally was to have I'll would say the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming which is Xbox and uh the content for the console uh and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games starting with the PC uh so when I think about the Activision portfolio it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console and then of course uh as to cover mobile sockets which we never had so we feel uh that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high-scale platforms where people play games which is uh the console PC and mobile uh but we're also excited about these new sockets right I mean the fact that even in this last quarter we expanded uh xcloud uh to Amazon uh TV uh I forget the name of what it's called but uh but that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot get reach new Gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play uh and that ultimately will show up in that software plus Services uh and transaction revenue for us uh which is really our long-term kpi uh and that's what we're building uh towards and that was the strategy behind Activision as an asset Amy if you wanted to add to it no I I do think the the real goal here is to be able to take a broaden set of content to more users in more places uh and really build what looks more like to us a software annuity and subscription business um with enhanced transactions and the ownership of Ip which is quite valuable long term as s mentioned things where uh with the ownership of Ip it can be monetized in multiple ways and uh I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and and how we're making making progress with Game Pass as well uh with some of the new announcements thank you Keith thanks Keith that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon thank you thank you all this concludes today's conference you may now disconnect your alliance at this time enjoy the rest of your day e e e e e\n\n"

       "GPT-4o is a multimodal and multilingual generative pretrained [transformer model](https://www.ibm.com/topics/transformer-model) released in May 2024 by [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence) developer OpenAI. It is the flagship [large language model (LLM)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) in the GPT-4 family of [AI models](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-model), which also includes GPT-4o mini, GPT-4 Turbo and the original GPT-4.\n",
       "\n",
       "The “o” in GPT-4o stands for omni and highlights that GPT-4o is a [multimodal AI model](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multimodal-ai) with sound and vision capabilities. This means it can accept prompt datasets as a mixture of text, audio, image and video input. GPT-4o is also capable of image generation. GPT-4o brings multimedia input and output capabilities to the same transformer-powered GPT-4 intelligence fueling the other models in its line.\n",
       "\n",
       "Revealed in May 2024 as part of OpenAI’s Spring Updates, ChatGPT’s new model appeared to translate spoken language in real time, adapt audio responses to include emotional content and engage in lifelike conversations.\n",

       "GPT-4o is an “all-in-one” flagship model capable of processing multimodal inputs and outputs on its own as a single neural network. With previous models such as GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5, users would need OpenAI APIs and other supporting models to input and generate varied content types. While GPT-4 Turbo can process image prompts, it is not capable of processing audio without API assistance.\n",
       "\n",
       "The multimodal nature of GPT-4o is the single biggest breakthrough as compared to GPT-4 Turbo and underpins many of its advancements:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Real-time audio conversations\n",
       "\n",
       "* Tone of voice capabilities\n",
       "\n",
       "* Built-in video processing\n",
       "\n",
       "* Image generation\n",
       "\n",
       "* Greater token efficiency\n",
       "\n",
       "### Real-time audio conversations\n",
       "\n",
       "GPT-4o’s faster speed and multimodal capabilities allow it to engage conversationally and translate languages at a more humanlike pace than GPT-4 Turbo. In a video demo as part of its release announcement[1](#footnotes1), ChatGPT-4o was shown translating in real time between English and Spanish speakers. GPT-4o brings [chatbot](https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots) voice support in over 50 languages.\n",
       "\n",
       "Because it can process audio inputs by itself, GPT-4o has lower latency—the time taken to produce output from the moment an input is received—than previous models. It responds to audio input in 320 milliseconds, comparable to the typical human response time of 210 milliseconds.\n",
       "\n",
       "Previous iterations of GPT-4 required multiple models assembled in a pipeline to provide a similar service, increasing its latency to 5.4 seconds. Before GPT-4o, OpenAI’s Whisper API converted audio prompts to text, fed them to GPT-4 Turbo, then text-to-speech (TTS) services converted GPT’s responses back to audio.\n",
       "\n",
       "GPT-4 Turbo was also a slower model in general. In benchmark tests by AI evaluation organization Artificial Analysis[2](#footnotes2), GPT-4o demonstrated a speed of 110 tokens per second, approximately three times faster than GPT-4 Turbo. In the same test, GPT-4o also outperformed many competitors, including Claude 3 Opus and Gemini 1.5 Pro.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Tone of voice capabilities\n",
       "\n",
       "The previous Whisper–GPT–TTS pipeline meant that when fielding audio inputs, GPT-4 Turbo was receiving only a text transcription of what was being said. The transcription isolates the content spoken by the user while filtering out background noise, speaker identities and tone of voice, depriving GPT of substantial contextual data.\n",
       "\n",
       "As a multimodal model, GPT-4o can process the entirety of an audio input and respond appropriately to this additional context. Its improved [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) enables it to include sentiment, tone and emotional content into its output generation when used in voice mode.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Built-in video processing\n",
       "\n",
       "GPT-4o handles image and video input in addition to text and audio. GPT-4o can connect to a live camera feed or record a user’s screen, then describe what it sees and answer questions. Users can turn on their smartphone cameras and speak with ChatGPT-4o the same way they would to a friend or colleague.\n",
       "\n",
       "Previously, the GPT-4 Vision API allowed GPT-4 Turbo to analyze visual content.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Image generation\n",
       "\n",
       "According to OpenAI’s release statement, GPT-4o offers self-contained image generation abilities. GPT-4 Turbo was only able to generate images by connecting to OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 model. GPT-4 Turbo would field a text-based user prompt, then DALL-E would create the image.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Greater token efficiency\n",
       "\n",
       "OpenAI improved GPT-4’s tokenization abilities with GPT-4o. Tokenization is the process by which LLMs convert words into data. Each token represents either a whole word or part of one and punctuation. AI models convert words into tokens, then apply complex mathematics to analyze that data.\n",
       "\n",
       "GPT-4o converts non-Roman languages, such as Chinese, Hindi and Arabic, into tokens much more efficiently than its predecessors. Because OpenAI charges API users per input or output token, GPT-4o’s improved efficiency in non-Roman scripts makes it more cost-effective for use cases in those languages.\n",
       "\n",
       "## What else can GPT-4o do?\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition to its new multimodal capabilities, GPT-4o brings many of the same functions as seen in prior iterations:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Question-answering\n",
       "\n",
       "* Document analysis and summarization\n",
       "\n",
       "* Sentiment analysis\n",
       "\n",
       "* Data analysis\n",
       "\n",
       "* Coding\n",
       "\n",
       "### Question-answering\n",
       "\n",
       "With a knowledge cutoff of October 2023, GPT-4o is OpenAI’s most current model in terms of its knowledge base. A knowledge cutoff is the point in time at which a model’s training data concludes. Users can ask GPT-4o questions and receive answers, though at the risk of [hallucinations](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-hallucinations).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Document analysis and summarization\n",
       "\n",
       "Users can upload files and have ChatGPT analyze and summarize them. GPT-4o’s context window of 128,000 tokens allows it to process large input datasets, though that is not quite as large as that of Claude 3.\n",
       "\n",
       "The context window of an LLM represents the maximum number of tokens that it can field while maintaining contextual awareness over the entire input sequence. A larger context window permits AI models to intake more complex prompts and include more information from users when generating responses.\n",
       "\n",
       "GPT-4 has already demonstrated a real-world ability to read documents via optical character recognition (OCR) by using the GPT-4 Vision API.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Sentiment analysis\n",
       "\n",
       "Sentiment analysis is the process of discerning how a person feels from their statements or behaviors. Researchers use AI models to perform sentiment analysis at scale—for example, when analyzing user reviews. As a multimodal model, GPT-4o can identify sentiment from audio input.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Data analysis\n",
       "\n",
       "GPT-4o can process complex datasets and distill actionable insights, as seen with [self-service analytics](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/self-service-analytics) platforms. It can also represent data as charts and graphs.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Coding\n",
       "\n",
       "GPT-4o isn’t the first LLM to have coding abilities, but its multimodal nature can simplify workflows for programmers. Rather than copy and paste code into the user interface, users can share their screens and allow GPT-4o to analyze their code, provide feedback and generate code snippets.\n",
       "\n",
       "## How does GPT-4o perform?\n",
       "\n",
       "When revealing GPT-4o, OpenAI released [LLM benchmarking](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llm-benchmarks) test results comparing their new model to the competition. GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 as it initially released, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus, Meta’s Llama 3 400B and Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.0 Ultra were tested alongside GPT-4o on several leading benchmarking tests.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tests included Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), which assesses knowledge base and problem-solving skills, and HumanEval, a code-checking test. OpenAI did not test GPT-4o against Google’s models in Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A (GPQA), a science exam requiring extensive reasoning. Nor was Llama 3 400B included in Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM), a math exam given in 10 languages.\n",
       "\n",
       "GPT-4o placed first in four out of the six tests, coming second to Claude 3 Opus in MGSM and to GPT-4 Turbo in Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs (DROP), which tests a model’s ability to reason across several paragraphs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, GPT-4o did not demonstrate a significant boost in performance over GPT-4 Turbo. Its comparative advancements lie chiefly with its multimodal capabilities and increased speed.\n",
       "\n",
       "## How can people access GPT-4o?\n",
       "\n",
       "OpenAI is making GPT-4o available for both free and premium users in various locations and products:\n",
       "\n",
       "* ChatGPT Plus, Team and Enterprise\n",
       "\n",
       "* ChatGPT Free\n",
       "\n",

       "### ChatGPT Plus, Teams and Enterprise\n",
       "\n",
       "Subscribers to OpenAI’s premium ChatGPT services have varying levels of access to GPT-4o. ChatGPT Plus users can send up to 80 messages every 3 hours on GPT-4o, with Team users getting more access. Enterprise users have unlimited access to GPT-4o.\n",
       "\n",
       "### ChatGPT Free\n",
       "\n",
       "Users of the free ChatGPT tier can engage with GPT-4o as the default model behind the chatbot while demand allows. When a free user reaches their limit, they’ll be rolled back to GPT-4o mini[3](#footnotes3).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Desktop and mobile apps\n",
       "\n",
       "OpenAI released a macOS desktop app along with GPT-4o that integrates the new model with a user’s MacBook. OpenAI’s ChatGPT mobile apps also grant access to GPT-4o based on a user’s subscription tier.\n",
       "\n",
       "### AI applications\n",
       "\n",
       "ChatGPT Plus, Teams and Enterprise users can build custom GPTs through which they and others can use specialized versions of GPT-4o tailored to specific use cases. Developers can also connect to GPT-4o through APIs to create other AI tools.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Microsoft Azure OpenAI Studio\n",
       "\n",
       "GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini are both available in Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Studio, part of Microsoft’s Azure [enterprise AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-ai) platform. As of publishing, Copilot continues to offer GPT-4 Turbo, though Microsoft announced in May 20244 that its AI service would soon receive GPT-4o support.\n",
       "\n",
       "## What are the risks of using GPT-4o?\n",
       "\n",
       "To mitigate potential use in vishing scams, deepfakes and other types of audio fraud, OpenAI limited GPT-4o to four preset voices at launch. But as with any genAI release, GPT-4o is an imperfect model. The risks of its use include:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Hallucinations:** Like all generative AI models, GPT-4o can hallucinate—when it detects patterns in its data that don’t exist, causing it to present incorrect information as factual. It is never advisable to use AI-generated content without first vetting or fact-checking it.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Data breaches:** OpenAI continues to store user-provided inputs and train its models with them. Users who enter protected data into ChatGPT might find their data appearing in the model’s replies to other users.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Intellectual property violations:** OpenAI trains its models on data available online, including copyrighted material such as news articles. Models can inadvertently generate copyrighted content as part of a response.\n",
       "\n",
       "OpenAI classified GPT-4o as a medium-risk model on their internal scale. Models are evaluated on four threat metrics—cybersecurity, CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats), persuasion and model autonomy. OpenAI assesses models according to the degree to which they can be used to advance developments in each threat field.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once assessed, models are given a score ranging from *Low* to *Critical* in each field, then assigned an overall score corresponding to their single highest threat ranking after considering any mitigation measures.\n",
       "\n",
       "GPT-4o earned a score of *Low* in three out of four categories, with a Medium score in Persuasion. This means it “can create (potentially interactive) content with comparable persuasive effectiveness to typical human-written content.”[5](#footnotes5) For example, malicious actors might theoretically use it to create disinformation articles and social media content.\n",

However, one question that often comes up is, can these AI models learn themselves just like humans do? As per the recent developments — **They can**. To understand this in a better way, let’s go back to our college days when C++, Java, and Python were the primary languages we needed to master to excel in computer science. Learning these languages requires understanding syntax, semantics, practical application, and problem-solving. So, to get a strong hold on these languages, we practised continuously (or you can say get trained). Also, we learned a lot from our classmates and professors. Right? Similarly, just like humans can learn from their own thinking, expertise and other mediums, perhaps LLMs can, too.\\n\\nHowever, gaining expertise or becoming a subject matter expert is quite a rigorous journey for both humans and LLMs. We know about the human learning process and reasoning capabilities for making decisions and completing tasks, but what does LLM training look like?\\n\\nCan I say?\\n\\n1. **Firstly, pre-training of LLM:** In this step, you help the model learn patterns, such as grammar, sentence structure, and even relationships between words and concepts.\\n2. **Instruction-tuning (or Fine-Tuning):** To fine-tune the model, a curated dataset containing examples of instructions and desired responses is used.\\n3. **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF):** Human evaluators rank model responses, which is used further to improve the model’s alignment with user expectations.\\n\\nThat makes sense, right? But what if we build an agentic workflow to make the model learn and give the output while doing all the checks independently? It would be like having your own assistant who can do all the work without any human intervention. Further, in this article we will talk about the 4 Agentic AI Design Patterns for Architecting AI Systems.\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\n* The article discusses how AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) like [**GPT**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/05/applications-of-gpt-4o/), can learn autonomously by adopting agentic workflows, which mimic human-like iterative problem-solving.\\n* Agentic workflows enhance AI performance by refining tasks step-by-step, similar to how humans review and improve their work repeatedly for better results.\\n* Four key Agentic Design Patterns — Reflection, Tool Use, Planning, and Multi-Agent Collaboration — are introduced as strategies that make AI systems more autonomous and capable.\\n\\n# What is Agentic Design Patterns?\\n\\nThe agentic design pattern is introduced as a solution for making LLMs more autonomous. Instead of just giving the model one prompt and expecting a final answer (like writing an essay in one go), an agent-like approach involves prompting the LLM multiple times, step by step. Each step refines the task, with the model improving its output iteratively.\\n\\nTo understand this better, let’s look at it like this:\\n\\nWhen we prompt an LLM in zero-shot mode, it’s like asking someone to write a story in one go without revising. LLMs do well at this, but they can do even better. By using an agent-like workflow, we can prompt the LLM multiple times in steps. Each step builds on the previous one, refining the response. Think of it like asking the LLM to go over the essay multiple times, improving it with each pass.\\n\\nBy each step, I meant:\\n\\nLet’s take the example of writing a code using Agentic workflow:\\n\\n1. **Plan an outline for the code:** Break down the task into smaller modules or functions.\\n2. **Gather information and content:** Research libraries, algorithms, or existing solutions. Do web searches or check the documentation if needed.\\n3. **Write the first draft of the code:** Implement the basic functionality, focusing on structure over perfection.\\n4. **Review the code for inefficiencies or errors:** Check for unnecessary code, bugs, or logic flaws.\\n5. **Revise the code:** Refactor, optimise, or add comments for clarity.\\n\\nRinse and repeat until the code is efficient and clean.\\n\\nBy allowing the model to work through these steps independently, the agentic design pattern enhances both human-like reasoning and efficiency. This is similar to how humans break down complex tasks, gather information, make improvements, and iterate until the final result is satisfactory. Now, let us understand the Agentic design pattern in detail.\\n\\n# Agentic Design Patterns: Evaluations\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nAndrew Ng’s analysis, shared in a letter on [**Deeplearning.ai**](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io), noted advancements in AI-driven code generation, particularly focusing on the performance of models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The evaluation was centred on these models’ capabilities to perform on the widely recognized HumanEval coding benchmark, a common standard for assessing an algorithm’s proficiency in writing code.\\n\\nThe data presented shows the evolution in AI coding abilities using AI agents. **GPT-3.5**, when tested in a zero-shot setting (i.e., without any prior examples), achieved a correctness rate of 48.1%. [**GPT-4**](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/), also evaluated in a zero-shot manner, demonstrated a significant improvement, with a 67.0% success rate. However, what stood out in the analysis was how integrating these models into an iterative agent workflow (Agentic workflow) drastically boosted their performance. When [**GPT-3.5**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) was wrapped in such an agent loop, its accuracy soared to an impressive 95.1%, far surpassing its baseline and even approaching human-level coding proficiency.\\n\\nThis finding underscores the transformative potential of iterative workflows (Agentic workflow) in enhancing **AI model** performance, suggesting that the future of AI-assisted coding may heavily rely on these more advanced, adaptive frameworks rather than on model size or architecture improvements alone.\\n\\nBut what are Agentic design patterns that complete the delegation of autonomy to AI systems, enabling them to act more independently and effectively? These patterns structure AI agents to perform tasks, make decisions, and communicate with other systems in a more human-like and autonomous manner, ultimately creating both savvy and dependable applications.\\x7f\\n\\n# 4 Types of Agentic Design Patterns that You Must Know\\n\\nIn Agentic AI and the key design patterns, it’s essential to understand how each pattern empowers large language models (LLMs) like GPT to behave more autonomously and effectively. These design patterns push the boundaries of what AI can do by encouraging self-evaluation, tool integration, strategic thinking, and collaboration. Let’s explore four vital agentic design patterns that shape how these models operate and perform complex tasks.\\n\\nHere are the types of agentic design patterns:\\n\\n# 1. Reflection Pattern\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nThe **Reflection Pattern** focuses on improving AI’s ability to evaluate and refine its own outputs. Imagine an LLM reviewing its generated content or code as if it were a human reviewer, identifying errors, gaps, or areas that need improvement and then offering suggestions for how to improve.\\n\\nThis self-critique loop is not limited to a single iteration. The AI can repeat the reflection process as many times as necessary to achieve a refined, polished result. For example, if tasked with writing software, the LLM can generate an initial version, critique its own logic and structure, and revise the code. The iterative nature of reflection leads to stronger, more reliable outputs over time.\\n\\nThis pattern is particularly useful in tasks that require precision, such as content creation, problem-solving, or code generation. Employing this approach can enhance the model’s accuracy and reliability through self-guided corrections.\\n\\nOne interesting example is Self-Reflective RAG. [**SELF-RAG**](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rag/langgraph_self_rag/) is a framework designed to improve language models’ quality and factual accuracy by integrating retrieval and self-reflection into the text generation process. Traditional **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** models enhance responses by incorporating relevant retrieved passages but often retrieve a fixed number of documents regardless of their relevance, which can introduce noise or irrelevant content. SELF-RAG addresses these limitations through an adaptive approach that retrieves information on demand and uses reflection tokens to assess the generation’s quality.\\n\\n## How SELF-RAG Uses Reflection?\\n\\nSELF-RAG incorporates self-reflection mechanisms via “reflection tokens,” which serve to evaluate various aspects of the text generation, such as relevance, support, and overall utility. During the generation process, the model evaluates whether retrieval is necessary and assesses the quality of the generated content by critiquing itself at different stages.\\n\\nHere’s the diagram for better understanding:\\n\\n![]()\\n\\n* **Traditional RAG** retrieves a fixed number of documents first, while **Self-RAG** performs retrieval dynamically based on the content being generated.\\n* **Self-RAG** evaluates multiple generated segments, critiques their quality, and selectively combines the most accurate information.\\n* **Self-RAG’s iterative process** enables refining the generation step by step, improving the accuracy and relevance of the output.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, Self-RAG adds an extra layer of self-reflection and refinement, leading to more reliable and precise answers.\\n\\n# 2. Tool Use Pattern\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nThe Tool Use Pattern significantly broadens an LLM’s capability by allowing it to interact with external tools and resources to enhance its problem-solving abilities. Instead of relying solely on internal computations or knowledge, an AI following this pattern can access databases, search the web, or even execute complex functions via programming languages like Python.\\n\\nFor instance, an **LLM** could be prompted to retrieve data from the web for a specific query, analyze it, and integrate it into its output. Alternatively, it might be tasked with calculating statistical results, generating images, or manipulating spreadsheets — actions that go beyond simple text generation. By incorporating the use of tools, LLMs evolve from static knowledge banks into dynamic agents capable of interacting with external systems to achieve goals.\\n\\nThis pattern is powerful because it allows **AI systems** to tackle more complex, multifaceted tasks where internal knowledge alone isn’t sufficient, expanding their utility into real-world applications.\\n\\n# 3. Planning Pattern\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nThe Planning Pattern enables an LLM to break down large, complicated tasks into smaller, more manageable components. Planning equips an agent with the ability to react to requests and strategically structure the steps needed to achieve a goal.\\n\\nInstead of tackling a problem linearly, ad hocly, an LLM using the Planning Pattern will create a roadmap of subtasks, determining the most efficient path to completion. For example, when coding, the LLM would first outline the overall structure before implementing individual functions. This avoids confusion or meandering logic and keeps the AI focused on the main objective.\\n\\n[**ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)**](https://research.google/blog/react-synergizing-reasoning-and-acting-in-language-models/) and [**ReWOO (Reasoning With Open Ontology)**](https://billxbf.github.io/works/ReWOO_preprint.pdf) further extend this approach by integrating decision-making and contextual reasoning into the planning process. ReAct enables the LLM to dynamically alternate between reasoning (thinking through the problem) and acting (performing specific tasks), allowing for more adaptive and flexible planning. By combining these two steps, the LLM can refine its approach iteratively, addressing unexpected challenges as they arise.\\n\\nReWOO, on the other hand, enhances the planning pattern by using an open-world ontology to guide reasoning. This means the LLM can incorporate broader contextual information and knowledge from various domains, leading to more informed decision-making. With ReWOO, the AI can adjust the plan in real-time based on newly acquired information or changing requirements, ensuring a more robust and comprehensive problem-solving approach.\\n\\nTogether, the Planning Pattern, ReAct, and ReWOO enable an LLM to handle complex tasks in a structured yet adaptive manner, resulting in efficient and goal-oriented execution.\\n\\nMoreover, generating a structured plan (or a “user\\\\_request\\\\_summary”) ensures that the AI keeps track of all steps and doesn’t lose sight of the broader task. This method ensures higher quality and consistency in the results, especially in complex problem-solving or multi-phase projects.\\n\\n# 4. Multi-Agent Pattern\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nThe Multi-Agent Pattern builds upon the concept of delegation, akin to project management in human teams. This pattern involves assigning different agents (which are instances of an LLM with specific roles or functions) to handle various subtasks. These agents can work independently on their assignments while also communicating and collaborating to achieve a unified outcome.\\n\\nThere are several types of multi-agent patterns:\\n\\n1. **Collaborative Agents**: Multiple agents work together on different parts of a task, sharing progress and building toward a unified result. Each agent may specialize in a different domain.\\n2. **Supervised Agents**: A central supervisor agent manages other agents, coordinating their activities and verifying results to ensure quality.\\n3. **Hierarchical Teams**: A structured system where higher-level agents oversee lower-level agents, with decision-making cascaded through levels to accomplish complex tasks.\\n\\n***For more details on this, explore:*** [***Multi-agent Collaboration***](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/multi-agent-collaboration/)***.***\\n\\nFor instance, in a scenario requiring both text analysis and numerical computation, two separate agents can handle each task, sharing their results to form a comprehensive solution. One agent might focus on understanding the context, while another processes data, and together they deliver a holistic response. This pattern is particularly powerful for tackling large-scale or complex problems that require diverse skill sets.\\n\\nIn short, the Multiagent Pattern mirrors how humans collaborate across specialities, ensuring that each agent focuses on its strengths while contributing to a greater, coordinated effort.\\n\\nBy mastering these four agentic design patterns, developers and users alike can unlock the full potential of AI systems. The Reflection Pattern improves accuracy and quality through self-evaluation, Tool Use enables dynamic, real-world interactions, Planning provides a roadmap for solving complex tasks, and Multiagent Collaboration ensures that multiple agents work together effectively. Together, these patterns create a foundation for building more intelligent, autonomous AI systems capable of addressing real-world challenges.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nAgentic Design Patterns emphasize the transformative potential of agentic workflows in making AI models, particularly **large language models (LLMs)**, more autonomous and efficient. It explains that while models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 perform well in zero-shot tasks, their accuracy and effectiveness significantly improve when adopting an iterative, agentic workflow. This method allows the model to break down tasks, self-evaluate, leverage external tools, plan strategically, and collaborate with other agents, enhancing their problem-solving capabilities.\\n\\nThe article introduces four key design patterns — Reflection, Tool Use, Planning, and Multiagent — that form the foundation of these agentic workflows. These patterns push the boundaries of what AI can do and enable AI systems to behave more independently and intelligently, much like humans handling complex tasks. This signals that future AI advancements will depend on increasing model size and developing more adaptive and strategic workflows.\\n\\n[Llm](/tag/llm?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[AI](/tag/ai?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[Llmops](/tag/llmops?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[Architecture](/tag/architecture?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[Genai](/tag/genai?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)\\n\\n--\\n\\n--\\n\\n2\\n\\n[![Yugank .Aman](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*BVHsZMj15ryXMndl)](/%40yugank.aman?source=post_page---post_author_info--397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[![Yugank .Aman](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*BVHsZMj15ryXMndl)](/%40yugank.aman?source=post_page---post_author_info--397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)Follow[## Written by Yugank .Aman](/%40yugank.aman?source=post_page---post_author_info--397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[139 Followers](/%40yugank.aman/followers?source=post_page---post_author_info--397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)·[43 Following](/%40yugank.aman/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)Follow\\n## Responses (2)\\n\\nSee all responses[Help](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[Status](https://medium.statuspage.io/?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[About](/about?autoplay=1&source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[Careers](/jobs-at-medium/work-at-medium-959d1a85284e?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)Press[Blog](https://blog.medium.com/?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[Privacy](https://policy.medium.com/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[Terms](https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[Text to speech](https://speechify.com/medium?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)[Teams](/business?source=post_page-----397798b44d5c---------------------------------------)', 'Four design patterns for AI agent workflows | Andrew Ng posted on the topic | LinkedIn\\nAgree & Join LinkedIn\\n\\nBy clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s [User Agreement](/legal/user-agreement?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_user-agreement), [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_privacy-policy), and [Cookie Policy](/legal/cookie-policy?trk=linkedin-tc_auth-button_cookie-policy).\\n\\n[Skip to main content](#main-content)\\n[LinkedIn](/?trk=public_post_nav-header-logo)\\n\\n* [Articles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/topics/home/?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_articles)\\n* [People](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/%2B/%2B?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_people)\\n* [Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_learning)\\n* [Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_jobs)\\n* [Games](https://www.linkedin.com/games?trk=public_post_guest_nav_menu_games)\\n\\n[Join now](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fandrewyng_one-agent-for-many-worlds-cross-species-activity-7179159130325078016-_oXr&trk=public_post_nav-header-join)\\n[Sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fandrewyng_one-agent-for-many-worlds-cross-species-activity-7179159130325078016-_oXr&fromSignIn=true&trk=public_post_nav-header-signin)\\n\\n# Andrew Ng’s Post\\n\\n[![View profile for Andrew Ng, graphic]()](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\\n[Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\\n\\nAndrew Ng is an Influencer\\n\\n Founder of DeepLearning.AI; Managing General Partner of AI Fund; Exec Chairman of Landing AI\\n\\n10mo\\n\\n* [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fandrewyng_one-agent-for-many-worlds-cross-species-activity-7179159130325078016-_oXr&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\\n\\nLast week, I described four design patterns for AI agentic workflows that I believe will drive significant progress: Reflection, Tool use, Planning and Multi-agent collaboration. Instead of having an LLM generate its final output directly, an agentic workflow prompts the LLM multiple times, giving it opportunities to build step by step to higher-quality output. Here, I\\'d like to discuss Reflection. It\\'s relatively quick to implement, and I\\'ve seen it lead to surprising performance gains.\\nYou may have had the experience of prompting ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini, receiving unsatisfactory output, delivering critical feedback to help the LLM improve its response, and then getting a better response. What if you automate the step of delivering critical feedback, so the model automatically criticizes its own output and improves its response? This is the crux of Reflection.\\nTake the task of asking an LLM to write code. We can prompt it to generate the desired code directly to carry out some task X. Then, we can prompt it to reflect on its own output, perhaps as follows:\\nHere’s code intended for task X:\\n[previously generated code]\\nCheck the code carefully for correctness, style, and efficiency, and give constructive criticism for how to improve it.\\nSometimes this causes the LLM to spot problems and come up with constructive suggestions. Next, we can prompt the LLM with context including (i) the previously generated code and (ii) the constructive feedback, and ask it to use the feedback to rewrite the code. This can lead to a better response. Repeating the criticism/rewrite process might yield further improvements. This self-reflection process allows the LLM to spot gaps and improve its output on a variety of tasks including producing code, writing text, and answering questions.\\nAnd we can go beyond self-reflection by giving the LLM tools that help evaluate its output; for example, running its code through a few unit tests to check whether it generates correct results on test cases or searching the web to double-check text output. Then it can reflect on any errors it found and come up with ideas for improvement.\\nFurther, we can implement Reflection using a multi-agent framework. I\\'ve found it convenient to create two agents, one prompted to generate good outputs and the other prompted to give constructive criticism of the first agent\\'s output. The resulting discussion between the two agents leads to improved responses.\\nReflection is a relatively basic type of agentic workflow, but I\\'ve been delighted by how much it improved my applications’ results.

It\\'s a pleasure to chat with you. This topic is very recurrent in our activity at [Butler Scientifics](https://es.linkedin.com/company/butler-scientifics?trk=public_post_comment-text). We have developed quite a few pieces of code with that prompting scheme you propose, but I have serious doubts about its fully automation.\\nThese doubts are based on the fact that a significant proportion of the deviations from the expected results occur due to a lack of technical detail in the initial prompt, usually because the programmer himself was not aware of certain functional requirements. In those cases, the solution was also functional, but the deviation from the expected result was evident. And I doubt an LLM can \"imagine\" those expectations.\\nI couldn\\'t tell you in what proportion of cases this happened, but it\\'s a significant problem.\\nAnyway, I congratulate any initiative to raise the level of abstraction of the solutions implemented by LLMs. We are also working in that direction from our #ButlerLabs. I\\'ll tell you about it ;)\\n\\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fandrewyng_one-agent-for-many-worlds-cross-species-activity-7179159130325078016-_oXr&trk=public_post_comment_like)\\n\\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fandrewyng_one-agent-for-many-worlds-cross-species-activity-7179159130325078016-_oXr&trk=public_post_comment_reply)\\n\\n1\\xa0Reaction\\n\\n[![Adeel Ahmad, graphic]()](https://au.linkedin.com/in/adeelahmadch?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\\n\\n[Adeel Ahmad](https://au.linkedin.com/in/adeelahmadch?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\\n\\n🚀 Passionate AI & Cloud Solutions Architect\\n\\n10mo\\n\\n* [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fandrewyng_one-agent-for-many-worlds-cross-species-activity-7179159130325078016-_oXr&trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\\n\\n[Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng?trk=public_post_comment-text) Thank you so much for sharing this.

By enabling the model to critique and improve its own output, you\\'re essentially incorporating a continuous learning and improvement process within a single interaction. This not only makes the model more self-reliant but also potentially reduces the need for human intervention in refining responses.\\nThe examples you provided, like code generation and refinement, illustrate the practical application of this concept and how it can lead to more accurate and efficient outputs. The idea of using multi-agent frameworks to facilitate a constructive discussion between agents is an innovative approach to further enhance this process.\\nIt\\'s exciting to see how Reflection and other design patterns for AI agentic workflows are driving advancements in the field. I look forward to seeing how these concepts continue to evolve and impact the development of more sophisticated and capable AI systems.

They will be able to understand our needs and preferences, and proactively help us with tasks and decision-making*”\\n>\\n> **Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft**\\n\\nThis vision is rapidly becoming a reality, and the driving force behind it is the evolution of AI agents into more intelligent, flexible, and proactive systems. But what enables these agents, specifically [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/03/an-introduction-to-large-language-models-llms/), to seamlessly adapt and respond to our needs? The answer lies in agentic design patterns—the underlying frameworks that allow LLMs to autonomously determine the best sequence of actions to accomplish a task. In this article, we’ll explore how these patterns are transforming LLMs into powerful, autonomous agents capable of driving the future of human-computer interaction. Let’s dive in and see how it all works.\\n\\n*Also, if you are looking for a course on AI Agents then, exploreour free course on [Introduction to AI Agents](https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/Introduction%20to%20AI%20Agents?utm_source=blog_page&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=SEO).*\\n\\n![agentic AI design patterns](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Evolution-of-Agentic-AI-Design-Patterns-in-LLM-Based-Applications.webp)\\n### Overview\\n\\n* **Agentic AI design patterns enable autonomous decision-making** in AI agents, improving LLMs’ flexibility and task execution.\\n* **GenAI agents** use machine learning to interpret data and perform tasks like customer service, coding, and content creation.\\n* **Tool use** allows LLMs to interact with external resources, enhancing their functionality and enabling more complex problem-solving.\\n* **Multi-agent collaboration** splits tasks between agents, optimizing complex workflows like supply chain management and autonomous systems.\\n* **Autonomous coding agents** streamline software development by generating and refining code, crucial in industries like fintech and autonomous vehicles.\\n\\n## Table of contents\\n\\n* [Agentic AI Design Patterns](#h-agentic-ai-design-patterns-nbsp)\\n* [Role of GenAI Agents](#h-role-of-genai-agents)\\n* [Evolving Role of LLMs in App Development](#h-evolving-role-of-llms-in-app-development)\\n* [Tool Use: Empowering LLMs with Functions](#h-tool-use-empowering-llms-with-functions-nbsp)\\n* [Multi-Agent Collaboration](#h-multi-agent-collaboration)\\n* [Autonomous Coding Agent](#h-autonomous-coding-agent)\\n* [Reflection: Self-Criticism](#h-reflection-self-criticism)\\n* [Planning: Autonomous Decision-making](#h-planning-autonomous-decision-making)\\n* [Additional Design Patterns](#h-additional-design-patterns)\\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](#h-frequently-asked-questions)\\n## Agentic AI Design Patterns\\n\\n*[Agentic AI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/09/06/agentic-ai-the-next-big-breakthrough-thats-transforming-business-and-technology/) Design Patterns are a set of structured approaches that guide the development and execution of autonomous AI agents.*\\n\\nThese patterns ensure robust, scalable, and efficient AI systems. Thus an AI developer finds them as a guide to improve the abilities of language models by impacting resolute aspirational behaviors.\\n\\nUltimately, this boils down to the role of AI agents and how these agents will help developers create not only savvy but also dependable and user-friendly applications.\\n\\nLet’s have a look at some of the prominent roles of AI agents.\\n\\n## Role of GenAI Agents\\n\\n[GenAI](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/09/generative-ai-for-enterprises/) agents utilize advanced algorithms and machine learning models to interpret data and execute tasks. They are employed in various real-life applications, such as customer services, chatbots, automated coding systems, and content creation tools.\\n\\nTo learn more about AI agents and their roles, read a detailed article on [AI Agents](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/category/ai-agent/#:~:text=AI%20agents%20operate%20based%20on,sensors%20or%20data%20intake%20mechanisms.).\\n\\n![Role of GenAI Agents](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-207.webp)\\n## Evolving Role of LLMs in App Development\\n\\nLLMs have come a long way since its inception. Their capabilities have opened new horizons, from customer service bots to intricate data analysis tools. Incorporating agentic design patterns into [LLMs](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/09/llms-on-mobile/) is a new milestone in this development.\\n\\nThe future of agentic framework in integration with LLMs is promising, with the evolution of more.\\n\\n* Advanced reflective agents\\n* Enhanced multi-agents collaboration\\n* Planning\\n* And improved tool use\\n\\nThese expected advancements in agentic workflow will strengthen the abilities of LLMs that make these workflows possible right now.\\n\\nBut before we look too far into the future, let’s examine the design patterns that make these workflows possible today.\\n\\n## Tool Use: Empowering LLMs with Functions\\n\\nTool use allows LLMs to interact with external tools during conversation generation. This pattern is useful as it allows agents to extend their functionalities. Tools can be functions written by developers, APIs for external services, or any resources LLM can interact with.\\n\\n**Let’s understand the pattern of tool use with the help of the diagram below.**\\n\\n![agentic AI design patterns tool use pattern](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-208.webp)\\n\\n* **Task Defining:** In the first step, the agent defines a task that it needs to solve. It can be a query, or any work related problem posed by a user.\\n* **LLM Processing**: The LLM evaluates the query and decides if it requires an external tool to solve the problem. It decides which tool to call based on its reasoning qualities.\\n* **Interaction between tool and environmen**t: Once the tool is finalized, it interacts with the environment. These actions generate feedback that is fed to the system.\\n* **Feedback to the LLM**: The feedback received from the interaction between the tool and environment is sent to the LLM. The LLM uses this feedback to refine its understanding of the task further.\\n* **Task resolution**: The LLM incorporates feedback and continues reasoning, possibly connecting more tools until the task is done.\\n\\n### Practical Applications\\n\\nIn real-world scenarios, application of implementing tool use patterns can be seen in automated data analysis, leveraging statistical tools to derive insights, or in customer support where they access the database to provide information swiftly.\\n\\n![Practical Applications](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-1.webp)\\n## Multi-Agent Collaboration\\n\\nThe Multi-Agent Collaboration pattern is a combination of multiple autonomous agents working together to achieve a common goal. The main objective of their collaboration is to break down complex tasks into subtasks executed by different agents.\\n\\nThis pattern is significant because **it enables division of labor enhancing problem solving capabilities.**\\n\\n![Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2.webp)\\n### Practical Applications\\n\\nMulti-agent collaboration includes multiple automated robots in manufacturing industries, where different agents various aspects of the production process, optimizing supply chain operations, or in supply chain management to coordinate robots in warehouses to manage stock, pick and pack items.\\n\\n## Autonomous Coding Agent\\n\\nAutonomous coding agents, sometimes referred as AI coding assistants are Gen AI agents designed to optimize code autonomously. In this process agents are designed to generate, modify, or improve code based on the given tasks.\\n\\nThese agents follow different patterns to optimize their effectiveness. Let’s have a look and understand one of them.\\n\\n![Autonomous Coding Agent](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-209.webp)\\n\\n* **User Input**: In the first step, users put a query or task through API or user interface, which is then refined and interpreted by the agents.\\n* **Agent Activation**: The central agent initiates the process and starts working on it. It accesses historical data, vector databases to tailor code generation followed by breaking the tasks into sub-task.\\n* **Code Generation**: Once done, agents generate and test code simultaneously based on the feedback.\\n\\n### Practical Applications\\n\\nIn the present day, the main applications of autonomous code generation include their use in developing software for autonomous vehicles, where they generate codes for decision making algorithms. Nowadays, the Fin-tech sector has also started automating their system to ensure secure transactions.\\n\\n## Reflection: Self-Criticism\\n\\nReflection is one of the most promising agentic design patterns as it allows one to critique its own output and improve it iteratively. By prompting an agent to reflect on its own output, we can harness its ability to suggest improvements. This design pattern can be extensively used in various interactive processes such as code generation, text writing and question answering.\\n\\nHere’s how it typically works:\\n\\n* **Self-awareness**: To answer a query, an agent first monitors its own internal state, including knowledge base, goals, plan and actions.\\n* **Reasoning**: Once it evaluates whether its current behavior is aligned with goals, it then starts reasoning to find if it should continue with its current strategy.\\n* **Adaption**: In this design pattern, agents have the capabilities to modify its behavior, meaning change in decision-making, updating its knowledge base, or altering the way it interacts with the environment.\\n\\n## Planning: Autonomous Decision-making\\n\\nPlanning is the most important design pattern on which agents rely since it allows LLM to autonomously decide on the steps which it needs to execute to accomplish a bigger task. This design pattern allows agents to break down complex problems into smaller subtasks.\\n\\nWhen LLMs are asked to produce a result based on [React prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react), without structured planning, the result can be lower quality. Generating a user query request along with the reasoning step can help LLMs plan their output.\\n\\n## Additional Design Patterns\\n\\nApart from the above-mentioned design patterns, there are three additional notable AI design patterns for autonomous agents, which includes the following:\\n\\n* **Reactive Agents**: These agents respond in real time, making them appropriate for dynamic conditions.\\n* **Proactive Agents**: Unlike the first agent, these agents take initiative based on predefined goals, making them ideal for long-term projects.\\n* **Hybrid Agents**: These agents have the characteristics of both reactive and proactive, making it hybrid by adapting to the context.\\n\\n![Additional Design Patterns](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-210.webp)\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, agentic design patterns lay the foundation for the evolution of LLM based applications. From tool usage to multi-agent collaboration, these patterns offer scalable solutions to various industries applications. As we look ahead, integration of agentic design patterns within LLM based applications holds immense potential for robust AI systems.\\n\\nTo start your Agentic AI journey, checkout our [Pinnacle Program](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/genaipinnacle?utm_source=blog_page&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=SEO) today!\\n\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n**Q1.

2025\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0|\\n\\n4 min read\\n\\n![](https://www.sikich.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/agenticAI.jpg)\\n\\nAgentic AI, or AI systems capable of autonomous decision-making and task execution, has become the latest buzzword in the [AI landscape](https://www.sikich.com/insight/salesforce-ai-leveraging-agentforce-for-smarter-customer-service/). But what exactly does it mean, and why is everyone talking about it?\\n\\nGenerative AI captured the world’s imagination with tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), demonstrating the power of AI to create new content based on a simple prompt. Now, the evolution to agentic AI takes it further—beyond providing answers to performing actions based on those answers and even orchestrating a series of actions.\\n\\nImagine a system that continuously monitors a marketing campaign, learns from the results, and automatically adjusts strategies without human intervention. Or picture a supply chain module in an ERP system autonomously placing orders for low-risk products to maintain optimal inventory levels.\\n\\nYou may wonder, *“That sounds great! Have I already missed out?”* The answer is a resounding no. We are in the early stages of this transformative technology. Even Gartner predicts that by 2028, only up to 15% of day-to-day workflows will be handled autonomously by AI agents.\\n\\n## The Levels of Agentic AI: A Framework for Understanding\\n\\nAgentic AI spans several levels, each reflecting a different degree of autonomy and sophistication in how AI systems act and learn:\\n\\n1. **Reactive Agents**\\n   Reactive agents operate on a simple sense-and-respond model, reacting to current inputs without memory or planning.\\n   *Examples: Basic chatbots, thermostats.*\\n2. **Proactive Agents**\\n   Proactive agents go beyond reacting by learning from past experiences and planning limited actions to achieve goals.\\n   *Examples: AI scheduling tools, recommendation systems.*\\n3. **Adaptive Agents**\\n   Adaptive agents learn dynamically from their interactions, optimizing responses and strategies in complex environments.\\n   *Examples: Self-driving cars, adaptive CRM tools.*\\n4. **Fully Agentic Systems**\\n   Fully autonomous AI systems independently set goals, make decisions, and perform tasks in unstructured environments.\\n   *Examples: Experimental platforms like [Microsoft’s Magentic-One](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/magentic-one-a-generalist-multi-agent-system-for-solving-complex-tasks/).*\\n\\nEach level builds upon the last, reflecting the growing capacity of AI to act autonomously and intelligently.\\n\\n## The Current State of Agentic AI\\n\\nAgentic AI is making its mark across industries, transitioning from experimental tools to practical applications. Current systems excel at:\\n\\n* **Automation at Scale:** Reducing the need for human input in repetitive processes.\\n* **Proactive Decision-Making:** Solving problems and making recommendations in real-time.\\n* **Personalization:** Tailoring actions based on contextual understanding.\\n\\n## Magentic-One by Microsoft\\n\\nMicrosoft’s Magentic-One is a standout example, showcasing the power of agentic AI. This currently experimental platform integrates with Microsoft’s enterprise ecosystem to:\\n\\n* Automate complex workflows using advanced task orchestration.\\n* Provide real-time, context-aware assistance.\\n* Continuously improve through self-learning systems.\\n\\n## Future Possibilities of Agentic AI\\n\\nAs agentic AI evolves, its potential will expand into even more advanced applications:\\n\\n1. **Enhanced Enterprise Autonomy:** AI agents that don’t just execute but also strategize and optimize processes.\\n2. **Cross-Domain Integration:** Bridging fields like healthcare and legal research for deeper problem-solving.\\n3. **Human Collaboration:** AI as a proactive partner, collaborating seamlessly with human teams.\\n\\nThese advancements could revolutionize areas such as autonomous logistics, predictive crisis management, and smart city design.\\n\\n## Risk and Mitigation Strategies\\n\\nAgentic AI, while promising, introduces several risks:\\n\\n* **Ethical Concerns:** Decisions may conflict with our values or norms.\\n* **Skewed Decision-Making:** Flaws in training data can foster errors.\\n* **Security Threats:** Vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks or misuse.\\n* **Loss of Oversight:** Over-reliance on autonomy risks human control and understanding.\\n\\n**Mitigation Strategies:**\\n\\n* Build transparent, explainable systems for decision-making.\\n* Continuously test and make corrections as you go.\\n* Implement robust security measures.\\n* Maintain human-in-the-loop systems to oversee critical decisions.\\n\\n## Realize the Power of Today’s Agentic AI\\n\\nAgentic AI represents a dramatic shift in how technology interacts with humans and the world. While the future is brimming with possibilities, the tools and capabilities available today are already game-changing.\\n\\nPlatforms like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Salesforce Einstein demonstrate advanced AI capabilities, offering proactive assistance, workflow automation, and contextual recommendations. However, these tools represent an early stage of agentic AI. They excel at enhancing productivity and decision-making but remain heavily reliant on user direction and input, stopping short of true autonomy. These systems are building blocks toward fully agentic solutions, offering organizations an opportunity to start leveraging AI for impactful results today.\\n\\nAt Sikich, we specialize in helping organizations define, build, and integrate these intelligent agents into their existing technology landscapes. Whether you’re looking to extend the functionality of Microsoft 365 Copilot, leverage the power of Salesforce Einstein, or enhance Dynamics 365 products, our expertise ensures a seamless transition from concept to implementation.\\n\\nDon’t wait for the future—start your journey with agentic AI today. Let Sikich guide you in transforming your vision into reality, unlocking the potential of these powerful tools to drive innovation and efficiency in your organization.\\n\\n****[Contact us](/technology/contact-us/) to explore how\\xa0the\\xa0[Sikich AI Solutions StudioTM](https://www.sikich.com/insight/sikich-expands-ai-consulting-capabilities/) can partner with you in building intelligent, autonomous solutions tailored to your needs.****\\n\\nThis publication contains general information only and Sikich is not, by means of this publication, rendering accounting, business, financial, investment, legal, tax, or any other professional advice or services.

Agentic AI is different from today’s chatbots and co-pilots, which themselves are often called “agents.” Agentic AI has the potential to make knowledge workers more productive and to automate multi-step processes across business functions. Deloitte predicts that in 2025, 25% of companies that use gen AI will launch agentic AI pilots or proofs of concept, growing to 50% in 2027.[1](#endnote-1) Some agentic AI applications, in some industries, and for some use cases, could see actual adoption into existing workflows in 2025, especially by the back half of the year.\\n\\nTheir efforts are being aided by startups and established tech companies developing agentic AI, both of which see the technology’s potential to spur revenue growth. Investors have poured over $2 billion into agentic AI startups in the past two years, focusing their investment on companies that target the enterprise market.[2](#endnote-2) Meanwhile, many tech companies, cloud providers, and others are developing their own agentic AI offerings. They are also making strategic acquisitions, and increasingly licensing agentic AI technology from startups and hiring their employees, instead of buying the companies outright.[3](#endnote-3)\\n\\n[## TMT Predictions 2025\\n\\nRead more from the Deloitte Center for Technology, Media & Telecommunications’ TMT Predictions 2025\\n\\n![Take me to TMT Predictions 2025.](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/USI-dev/2023/january/pitching-machine/assets/icon-arrow-up-green.png \"Take me to TMT Predictions 2025\")](/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2025.html)\\n\\n## Agentic AI puts the “agency” in agent\\n\\nGen AI chatbots and co-pilots are sophisticated; they can interact intuitively with humans, synthesize complex information, and generate content. But they lack the degree of agency and autonomy that agentic AI promises. While chatbots and agents share the same foundation—large language models (LLM)—additional technologies and techniques enable agents to act independently, break a job down into discrete steps, and complete their work with minimal human supervision or intervention. AI agents don’t just interact. They more effectively reason and act on behalf of the user.\\n\\nAs its name suggests, agentic AI has “agency”: the ability to act, and to choose which actions to take.[4](#endnote-4) Agency implies autonomy, which is the power to act and make decisions *independently*.[5](#endnote-5) When we extend these concepts to agentic AI, we can say it can act on its own to plan, execute, and achieve a goal—it becomes “agentic”. [6](#endnote-6) The goals are set by humans, but the agents determine how to fulfill those goals.\\n\\nAn example can illustrate the difference between agentic AI and co-pilots and chatbots. Co-pilots that assist software developers by testing and suggesting code are one of the most successful gen AI use cases to date.[7](#endnote-7) They can make experienced software engineers more productive and increase the effectiveness of junior coders. They can convert natural language prompts (in multiple languages) into suggestions for code, and test code for consistency. But such co-pilots only respond to prompts from engineers and do not show agency. With agentic AI, the software “engineer” takes this a step further. A human coder can enter ideas for software through a prompt, and the agentic AI “software engineer” converts those ideas into executable code, a process that automates multiple steps in the software development process.\\n\\nFor example, Cognition Software launched “Devin” in March 2024 with the goal of creating an autonomous software engineer capable of reasoning, planning, and completing complex engineering tasks that require thousands of decisions.[8](#endnote-8) Devin was designed to perform programming jobs unassisted, based on natural language prompts from human programmers. These jobs include designing full applications, testing and fixing codebases, and training and tuning LLMs.[9](#endnote-9) Competitors like Codeium, which focuses on enterprise software development, and open-source versions of Devin, hit the market in summer 2024.[10](#endnote-10)\\n\\nAgentic AI software engineers share similar capabilities and vulnerabilities.[11](#endnote-11) One vulnerability is that they currently make too many errors to handle full, or even partial, jobs without human oversight. In a recent benchmarking test, Devin was able to resolve nearly 14% of GitHub issues\\xa0from real-world code repositories—twice as good as LLM-based chatbots,[12](#endnote-12) but not fully autonomous. Big tech companies[13](#endnote-13) and startups are striving to make agentic AI software engineers more autonomous and reliable, so human coders—and their employers—can trust them to handle parts of their workload (figure 1).\\n\\n### Share image\\n\\n* Share\\n  + twitter\\n  + linkedin\\n  + facebook\\n\\n### Or copy link\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n## Augmenting and amplifying labor productivity\\n\\nAgentic AI software engineers are just one example of how autonomous generative AI agents could transform how work is done (see [Promising use cases for autonomous gen AI agents](#promising-use)\\xa0below). As agentic AI improves, its impact could be enormous. There are over 100 million knowledge workers in the US, and over 1.25 billion knowledge workers globally.[14](#endnote-14) Total factor productivity,[15](#endnote-15) a useful proxy for knowledge work, has stagnated in the United States, growing 0.8% from 1987 to 2023 and only 0.5% from 2019 to 2023.[16](#endnote-16) In most OECD countries, the story is the same.[17](#endnote-17) Attempts to increase the productivity of knowledge work by automating tasks have met with only partial success. Many companies also need more knowledge workers. Shortfalls of customer service representatives, semiconductor engineers, and seemingly everything in between persist. When new workers start, they need to be productive quickly.\\n\\nExpert systems and robotic process automation (RPA) can falter when processes are ambiguous or require multiple steps. Systems based on traditional machine learning require extensive training, which is tailored for specific purposes. Built on LLMs, agentic AI can be more flexible, and it can address a broader range of use cases than machine learning or deep learning.\\n\\nAgentic AI can significantly advance the capabilities of LLMs and could vindicate the investments companies are making in gen AI. The public release of gen AI tools has quickly captured the attention of executives. It was easy to imagine how their organizations could use the technology. Quantifiable business value from gen AI has often been elusive, however. Challenges with data foundations, risk and governance policies, and talent gaps make it hard for companies to scale gen AI initiatives.[18](#endnote-18) Only 30% of gen AI pilots make it to full production.[19](#endnote-19) Lack of trust in gen AI output, and potential “real world” consequences from gen AI mistakes, give executives pause.[20](#endnote-20)\\n\\nCompanies that develop and implement agentic AI need to consider the challenges of gen AI, plus the complexity of building bots that can reason, act, collaborate, and create. Most importantly, gen AI agents of all kinds need to be reliable for enterprises to use them: Getting the job right most of the time isn’t enough. There are some use cases and applications in late 2024 that show encouraging signs of being reliable enough for adoption in early 2025.\\n\\nThe potential payoff is worth the effort, however, and early results seem promising. Companies are learning how to boost LLM performance by combining these models with other AI technologies and training techniques. While autonomous and reliable agents are the goal, incremental increases in accuracy and independence could help companies reach their early productivity and efficiency goals for gen AI overall.[21](#endnote-21) With their range of applications—both horizontal and vertical—and clear business goals, agentic AI looks more like the gen AI solutions executives may have expected in the first place.\\n\\n## Gen AI agents explained: A closer look\\n\\nGenerative AI agents can break down a complex task into a series of steps, execute them, and work through unexpected barriers. They can sense their environment, which depending on the use case can be virtual, physical, or a combination of the two. To complete a task, agentic AI can determine which actions to take, recruit assistance from tools, databases, and other agents, and deliver results based on its goals set by humans.\\n\\nAgentic AI is an emerging technology—and it continues to evolve—but it has some common characteristics and capabilities:\\n\\n* **Built on foundation models:** Foundation models like LLMs enable agentic AI to reason, analyze, and adapt to complex and unpredictable workflows. This makes it more flexible than RPA and expert systems. LLMs are improving rapidly, with enhanced reasoning and ability to break tasks into smaller steps among the most recent breakthroughs.[22](#endnote-22) But foundation models alone can’t interact with their environment, make decisions, or execute tasks.[23](#endnote-23) They must be augmented by other technologies and capabilities.\\n* **Acts autonomously:** While the degree of autonomy varies, agentic AI can be trained to plan and execute complex tasks largely on its own. By introducing reasoning tokens, chain-of-thought models can solve more complex challenges than previous LLMs. Chain-of-thought models are slower to respond but are more deliberative in how they reason through a problem; they can correct their own errors; and they can show the steps they have taken to reach a solution.[24](#endnote-24)\\n* **Senses the environment:** Agentic AI can perceive the environment, process information, and understand the context of the tasks it is given.[25](#endnote-25) Advanced agentic AI can process multimodal data, such as videos, images, audio, text, and numbers.\\n* **Uses tools:** Agentic AI interacts with tools and systems to complete tasks, such as software, enterprise applications, and the internet.\\n* **Orchestrates:** Agentic AI can direct the participation of other systems and bots to complete a task. With multiagent systems, this means collaborating with other autonomous generative AI agents.\\n* **Accesses memory:** LLMs are stateless: Each interaction is processed independently, and information is not retained when an interaction is complete. With the addition of retrieval mechanisms and databases, agentic AI can access short-term memory to maintain context while performing a specific task, and long-term memory to learn and improve from experience.[26](#endnote-26)\\n\\nStartups and big tech are developing multiagent gen AI systems, including tools that can help organizations build their own custom agents.\\n\\nSome of the latest models employ chain-of-thought functions that, while slower and more deliberative than prior large-scale models, enable higher-order reasoning on complex problems.[27](#endnote-27) Multimodal data analysis can make agentic AI more flexible by expanding the kinds of data that can be interpreted and produced. Multimodal AI also shows that agentic AI can be even more powerful when combined with other kinds of AI technologies such as computer vision (image recognition), and transcription and translation.[28](#endnote-28) Like agents themselves, multimodal AI is still developing.\\n\\nTrue multiagent systems, in which work is orchestrated among a network of autonomous agents, are being developed now, with some pilots being launched in late 2024.[29](#endnote-29) Multiagent models often outperform single-model systems by distributing tasks, especially in complex environments.[30](#endnote-30) Startups and big tech are developing multiagent gen AI systems, including tools that can help organizations build their own custom agents.[31](#endnote-31)\\n\\n## Promising use cases for autonomous gen AI agents\\n\\nBig tech companies and startups are developing early-stage solutions that can partially automate functions like software development, sales, marketing, and regulatory compliance. What follows is a snapshot of today’s examples, not an exhaustive list of applications. Some are based on proofs of concept and demos that are promising but are not ready for enterprise deployment. While these examples are cross-industry, industry-specific agentic applications are also emerging.\\n\\n**Customer support:** Customer service is an essential—and often stressful—job, with an annual turnover rate of 38%.[32](#endnote-32) Effective automation of parts of the customer support workflow could reduce stress and tedium for staff, and help companies serve more customers.[33](#endnote-33) Agentic AI can handle more complex customer inquiries than today’s customer support chatbots, and they can act autonomously to resolve issues. In one example, an audio company is using agentic AI to help customers set up new equipment, a multistep process that usually requires a human agent. If a human agent is required, the agentic AI compiles relevant information and summarizes the issue before transferring the customer.[34](#endnote-34) The next wave of customer support agents will likely integrate multimodal data such as voice and video in addition to text-based chat.\\n\\n**Cybersecurity:** Cybersecurity experts epitomize the shortage of skilled knowledge workers: Globally, there’s a shortfall of four million today.[35](#endnote-35) Meanwhile, malicious actors are using gen AI to infiltrate cybersecurity systems. Emerging agentic cybersecurity systems can make human experts more efficient by automating aspects of their work. They can autonomously detect attacks and generate reports, improving system security and reducing the workload of human experts by up to 90%.[36](#endnote-36) Agentic AI can also help software development teams detect vulnerabilities in new code. It can run tests and communicate directly with developers to explain how to fix a problem—something human engineers must do manually today.[37](#endnote-37)\\n\\n**Regulatory compliance:** Companies across industries, including financial services and healthcare, are required to conduct periodic regulatory compliance reviews. The increased size and complexity of relevant regulations, and the dearth of compliance professionals, makes compliance a growing challenge. Startups are developing agentic AI that can analyze regulations and corporate documents, and quickly determine whether the company is compliant. The agent can cite specific regulations, and proactively provide analysis and advice to human regulatory professionals.[38](#endnote-38) Companies that use gen AI today cite regulatory compliance as their top barrier to developing and deploying gen AI, ahead of issues like a lack of AI technical talent, and implementation challenges.[39](#endnote-39) Regulatory uncertainty plays a role, but so does the reach and complexity of new regulations. By helping companies understand and comply with regulations as they’re enacted, a more agentic AI solution could help accelerate wider gen AI adoption across enterprises.\\n\\n**Agent builders and orchestrators:** Agentic AI solutions are emerging to help automate other cross-industry and vertical-specific workflows. Companies may not need to wait for the market, however. They can build their own agents and multiagent systems. With Google’s Vertex, companies can use no-code tools to create agents for specific tasks, such as building marketing collateral based on previous marketing campaigns.[40](#endnote-40) LangChain uses open-source technology to help companies construct multiagentic systems. For example, startup Paradigm has launched a “smart spreadsheet” in which multiple agentic AIs partner to collect data from diverse sources, structure it, and complete tasks.[41](#endnote-41)\\n\\n## Bottom line\\n\\nAgentic AI has enormous potential to help increase the productivity of knowledge workers by automating entire workflows and discrete tasks. Its ability to take independent action, as single agents or in concert with other agents, sets it apart from today’s chatbots and co-pilots. Yet, agentic AI is in the early stages of development and adoption. As impressive as early agentic examples may be, these agents can make mistakes and get stuck in loops. In multiagent systems, “hallucinations” can spread from one agent to another; they can persuade other agents to take the wrong steps and give incorrect answers.[42](#endnote-42) Although agentic AI can be mainly autonomous, often having a human review decisions after they’ve been made (also known as “human on the loop” rather than the more restrictive “human in the loop”) can make agentic AI more suitable for deployment today. When gen AI agents get stuck, they can consult human experts who help them resolve the challenge and move forward. In this model, agentic AI is like a junior employee who can learn by experience while performing valuable work.[43](#endnote-43)\\n\\nBecause the vision for agentic AI is compelling and the technology is evolving rapidly, companies should prepare themselves now.\\n\\nWhile some companies are investing billions to create consistent and reliable agentic AI, it’s not clear when this will happen, or under what circumstances. Will agentic AI reach widespread adoption in 2025, or within the next five years? Will ubiquity require breakthrough innovation, or tweaking current AI technologies and training methods? If the big companies and startups developing agentic AI are successful, the game will change quickly. Imagine autonomous gen AI agents that can process multimodal data, use tools, orchestrate other agents, remember and learn, and execute tasks consistently and reliably. Imagine further that custom agents can be quickly and easily developed by enterprises in “no-code environments” using just conversational text prompts.\\n\\nBecause the vision for agentic AI is compelling and the technology is evolving rapidly, companies should prepare themselves now. As they prepare, they should consider the following approaches.\\n\\n**Prioritize and redesign workflows for agentic AI:** Consider which tasks and workflows are well-suited for agentic AI to execute, based on the technology’s capabilities and where the highest value is for your company. Redesign them to remove unnecessary steps. Ensure that agentic AI solutions have a clear goal, and access to the data, tools, and systems they will require. Although these agents can help other agents navigate their environment, cluttered and sub-optimized processes could deliver disappointing results.\\n\\n**Focus on data governance and cybersecurity:** For agentic AI to deliver value, it must have access to valuable and potentially sensitive enterprise data, as well as internal systems and external resources. Companies should put strong data governance and cybersecurity in place before getting started with autonomous generative AI agents. For gen AI early adopters, the top areas where they’re increasing IT investment are data management (75%) and cybersecurity (73%).[44](#endnote-44) Despite these investments, 58% are highly concerned about using sensitive data in models and managing data security. And only 23% say they’re highly prepared for managing gen AI risk and governance. In short, many of today’s gen AI leaders seem unprepared for the advent of agentic AI. If these leaders are not ready, companies that are still on the gen AI sidelines surely have further to go.\\n\\n**Balance risk and reward:** When starting with agentic AI, companies should consider the level of autonomy and data access agents are permitted. Low risk use cases with non-critical data and human oversight can help companies build the data management, cybersecurity, and governance for safe agentic AI applications. Once these are in place, companies should consider higher value use cases that use strategic data, access to more tools, and more autonomy.\\n\\n**Maintain healthy skepticism:** Agentic AI is evolving and will likely be more capable in the next year, and will be applied to more horizontal and vertical-specific use cases. Expect impressive demos, simulations, and product announcements throughout 2025. But the challenges we’ve noted may take some time to resolve. Until these challenges are addressed, agentic AI performance in controlled settings is unlikely to deliver improved enterprise performance. Evaluate and question carefully.\\n\\n### Continue the conversation\\n\\n##### Meet the industry leader\\n\\n![Img](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone2/fr/fr/img/profiles/a-d/arianne-bucaille.jpg)\\n\\nAriane Bucaille\\n\\nGlobal Technology, Media & Telecommunications Industry leader\\n\\n![Img](${leaderImageLink2})\\n\\n${leaderName2}\\n\\n${leaderRole2}\\n\\n![Img](${leaderImageLink3})\\n\\n${leaderName3}\\n\\n${leaderRole3}\\n\\n![Img](${leaderImageLink4})\\n\\n${leaderName4}\\n\\n${leaderRole4}\\n\\n![Img](${leaderImageLink5})\\n\\n${leaderName5}\\n\\n${leaderRole5}\\n\\n![Img](${leaderImageLink6})\\n\\n${leaderName6}\\n\\n${leaderRole6}\\n\\n#### Let’s make this work.\\n\\nChange your Analytics and performance cookie settings to access this feature.\\n\\n### By\\n\\n#### Jeff Loucks\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\n### Jeff Loucks\\n\\nExecutive director, Deloitte’s Center for Technology, Media & Telecommunications | Deloitte Services LP\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\nJeff Loucks is the executive director of Deloitte\\'s Center for Technology, Media & Telecommunications, Deloitte Services LP.

read\n\n![](https://www.sikich.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/agenticAI.jpg)\n\nAgentic AI, or AI systems capable of autonomous decision-making and task execution, has become the latest buzzword in the [AI landscape](https://www.sikich.com/insight/salesforce-ai-leveraging-agentforce-for-smarter-customer-service/). But what exactly does it mean, and why is everyone talking about it?\n\nGenerative AI captured the world’s imagination with tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), demonstrating the power of AI to create new content based on a simple prompt. Now, the evolution to agentic AI takes it further—beyond providing answers to performing actions based on those answers and even orchestrating a series of actions.\n\nImagine a system that continuously monitors a marketing campaign, learns from the results, and automatically adjusts strategies without human intervention. Or picture a supply chain module in an ERP system autonomously placing orders for low-risk products to maintain optimal inventory levels.\n\nYou may wonder, *“That sounds great! Have I already missed out?”* The answer is a resounding no. We are in the early stages of this transformative technology. Even Gartner predicts that by 2028, only up to 15% of day-to-day workflows will be handled autonomously by AI agents.\n\n## The Levels of Agentic AI: A Framework for Understanding\n\nAgentic AI spans several levels, each reflecting a different degree of autonomy and sophistication in how AI systems act and learn:\n\n1. **Reactive Agents**\n   Reactive agents operate on a simple sense-and-respond model, reacting to current inputs without memory or planning.\n   *Examples: Basic chatbots, thermostats.*\n2. **Proactive Agents**\n   Proactive agents go beyond reacting by learning from past experiences and planning limited actions to achieve goals.\n   *Examples: AI scheduling tools, recommendation systems.*\n3. **Adaptive Agents**\n   Adaptive agents learn dynamically from their interactions, optimizing responses and strategies in complex environments.\n   *Examples: Self-driving cars, adaptive CRM tools.*\n4. **Fully Agentic Systems**\n   Fully autonomous AI systems independently set goals, make decisions, and perform tasks in unstructured environments.\n   *Examples: Experimental platforms like [Microsoft’s Magentic-One](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/magentic-one-a-generalist-multi-agent-system-for-solving-complex-tasks/).*\n\nEach level builds upon the last, reflecting the growing capacity of AI to act autonomously and intelligently.\n\n## The Current State of Agentic AI\n\nAgentic AI is making its mark across industries, transitioning from experimental tools to practical applications. Current systems excel at:\n\n* **Automation at Scale:** Reducing the need for human input in repetitive processes.\n* **Proactive Decision-Making:** Solving problems and making recommendations in real-time.\n* **Personalization:** Tailoring actions based on contextual understanding.\n\n## Magentic-One by Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft’s Magentic-One is a standout example, showcasing the power of agentic AI. This currently experimental platform integrates with Microsoft’s enterprise ecosystem to:\n\n* Automate complex workflows using advanced task orchestration.\n* Provide real-time, context-aware assistance.\n* Continuously improve through self-learning systems.\n\n## Future Possibilities of Agentic AI\n\nAs agentic AI evolves, its potential will expand into even more advanced applications:\n\n1. **Enhanced Enterprise Autonomy:** AI agents that don’t just execute but also strategize and optimize processes.\n2. **Cross-Domain Integration:** Bridging fields like healthcare and legal research for deeper problem-solving.\n3. **Human Collaboration:** AI as a proactive partner, collaborating seamlessly with human teams.\n\nThese advancements could revolutionize areas such as autonomous logistics, predictive crisis management, and smart city design.\n\n## Risk and Mitigation Strategies\n\nAgentic AI, while promising, introduces several risks:\n\n* **Ethical Concerns:** Decisions may conflict with our values or norms.\n* **Skewed Decision-Making:** Flaws in training data can foster errors.\n* **Security Threats:** Vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks or misuse.\n* **Loss of Oversight:** Over-reliance on autonomy risks human control and understanding.\n\n**Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n* Build transparent, explainable systems for decision-making.\n* Continuously test and make corrections as you go.\n* Implement robust security measures.\n* Maintain human-in-the-loop systems to oversee critical decisions.\n\n## Realize the Power of Today’s Agentic AI\n\nAgentic AI represents a dramatic shift in how technology interacts with humans and the world. While the future is brimming with possibilities, the tools and capabilities available today are already game-changing.\n\nPlatforms like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Salesforce Einstein demonstrate advanced AI capabilities, offering proactive assistance, workflow automation, and contextual recommendations. However, these tools represent an early stage of agentic AI. They excel at enhancing productivity and decision-making but remain heavily reliant on user direction and input, stopping short of true autonomy. These systems are building blocks toward fully agentic solutions, offering organizations an opportunity to start leveraging AI for impactful results today.\n\nAt Sikich, we specialize in helping organizations define, build, and integrate these intelligent agents into their existing technology landscapes. Whether you’re looking to extend the functionality of Microsoft 365 Copilot, leverage the power of Salesforce Einstein, or enhance Dynamics 365 products, our expertise ensures a seamless transition from concept to implementation.\n\nDon’t wait for the future—start your journey with agentic AI today. Let Sikich guide you in transforming your vision into reality, unlocking the potential of these powerful tools to drive innovation and efficiency in your organization.\n\n****[Contact us](/technology/contact-us/) to explore how the [Sikich AI Solutions StudioTM](https://www.sikich.com/insight/sikich-expands-ai-consulting-capabilities/) can partner with you in building intelligent, autonomous solutions tailored to your needs.****\n\nThis publication contains general information only and Sikich is not, by means of this publication, rendering accounting, business, financial, investment, legal, tax, or any other professional advice or services.

Agentic AI is different from today’s chatbots and co-pilots, which themselves are often called “agents.” Agentic AI has the potential to make knowledge workers more productive and to automate multi-step processes across business functions. Deloitte predicts that in 2025, 25% of companies that use gen AI will launch agentic AI pilots or proofs of concept, growing to 50% in 2027.[1](#endnote-1) Some agentic AI applications, in some industries, and for some use cases, could see actual adoption into existing workflows in 2025, especially by the back half of the year.\n\nTheir efforts are being aided by startups and established tech companies developing agentic AI, both of which see the technology’s potential to spur revenue growth. Investors have poured over $2 billion into agentic AI startups in the past two years, focusing their investment on companies that target the enterprise market.[2](#endnote-2) Meanwhile, many tech companies, cloud providers, and others are developing their own agentic AI offerings. They are also making strategic acquisitions, and increasingly licensing agentic AI technology from startups and hiring their employees, instead of buying the companies outright.[3](#endnote-3)\n\n[## TMT Predictions 2025\n\nRead more from the Deloitte Center for Technology, Media & Telecommunications’ TMT Predictions 2025\n\n![Take me to TMT Predictions 2025.](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/USI-dev/2023/january/pitching-machine/assets/icon-arrow-up-green.png \"Take me to TMT Predictions 2025\")](/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2025.html)\n\n## Agentic AI puts the “agency” in agent\n\nGen AI chatbots and co-pilots are sophisticated; they can interact intuitively with humans, synthesize complex information, and generate content. But they lack the degree of agency and autonomy that agentic AI promises. While chatbots and agents share the same foundation—large language models (LLM)—additional technologies and techniques enable agents to act independently, break a job down into discrete steps, and complete their work with minimal human supervision or intervention. AI agents don’t just interact. They more effectively reason and act on behalf of the user.\n\nAs its name suggests, agentic AI has “agency”: the ability to act, and to choose which actions to take.[4](#endnote-4) Agency implies autonomy, which is the power to act and make decisions *independently*.[5](#endnote-5) When we extend these concepts to agentic AI, we can say it can act on its own to plan, execute, and achieve a goal—it becomes “agentic”. [6](#endnote-6) The goals are set by humans, but the agents determine how to fulfill those goals.\n\nAn example can illustrate the difference between agentic AI and co-pilots and chatbots. Co-pilots that assist software developers by testing and suggesting code are one of the most successful gen AI use cases to date.[7](#endnote-7) They can make experienced software engineers more productive and increase the effectiveness of junior coders. They can convert natural language prompts (in multiple languages) into suggestions for code, and test code for consistency. But such co-pilots only respond to prompts from engineers and do not show agency. With agentic AI, the software “engineer” takes this a step further. A human coder can enter ideas for software through a prompt, and the agentic AI “software engineer” converts those ideas into executable code, a process that automates multiple steps in the software development process.\n\nFor example, Cognition Software launched “Devin” in March 2024 with the goal of creating an autonomous software engineer capable of reasoning, planning, and completing complex engineering tasks that require thousands of decisions.[8](#endnote-8) Devin was designed to perform programming jobs unassisted, based on natural language prompts from human programmers. These jobs include designing full applications, testing and fixing codebases, and training and tuning LLMs.[9](#endnote-9) Competitors like Codeium, which focuses on enterprise software development, and open-source versions of Devin, hit the market in summer 2024.[10](#endnote-10)\n\nAgentic AI software engineers share similar capabilities and vulnerabilities.[11](#endnote-11) One vulnerability is that they currently make too many errors to handle full, or even partial, jobs without human oversight. In a recent benchmarking test, Devin was able to resolve nearly 14% of GitHub issues from real-world code repositories—twice as good as LLM-based chatbots,[12](#endnote-12) but not fully autonomous. Big tech companies[13](#endnote-13) and startups are striving to make agentic AI software engineers more autonomous and reliable, so human coders—and their employers—can trust them to handle parts of their workload (figure 1).\n\n### Share image\n\n* Share\n  + twitter\n  + linkedin\n  + facebook\n\n### Or copy link\n\nCopy\n\n## Augmenting and amplifying labor productivity\n\nAgentic AI software engineers are just one example of how autonomous generative AI agents could transform how work is done (see [Promising use cases for autonomous gen AI agents](#promising-use) below). As agentic AI improves, its impact could be enormous. There are over 100 million knowledge workers in the US, and over 1.25 billion knowledge workers globally.[14](#endnote-14) Total factor productivity,[15](#endnote-15) a useful proxy for knowledge work, has stagnated in the United States, growing 0.8% from 1987 to 2023 and only 0.5% from 2019 to 2023.[16](#endnote-16) In most OECD countries, the story is the same.[17](#endnote-17) Attempts to increase the productivity of knowledge work by automating tasks have met with only partial success. Many companies also need more knowledge workers. Shortfalls of customer service representatives, semiconductor engineers, and seemingly everything in between persist. When new workers start, they need to be productive quickly.\n\nExpert systems and robotic process automation (RPA) can falter when processes are ambiguous or require multiple steps. Systems based on traditional machine learning require extensive training, which is tailored for specific purposes. Built on LLMs, agentic AI can be more flexible, and it can address a broader range of use cases than machine learning or deep learning.\n\nAgentic AI can significantly advance the capabilities of LLMs and could vindicate the investments companies are making in gen AI. The public release of gen AI tools has quickly captured the attention of executives. It was easy to imagine how their organizations could use the technology. Quantifiable business value from gen AI has often been elusive, however. Challenges with data foundations, risk and governance policies, and talent gaps make it hard for companies to scale gen AI initiatives.[18](#endnote-18) Only 30% of gen AI pilots make it to full production.[19](#endnote-19) Lack of trust in gen AI output, and potential “real world” consequences from gen AI mistakes, give executives pause.[20](#endnote-20)\n\nCompanies that develop and implement agentic AI need to consider the challenges of gen AI, plus the complexity of building bots that can reason, act, collaborate, and create. Most importantly, gen AI agents of all kinds need to be reliable for enterprises to use them: Getting the job right most of the time isn’t enough. There are some use cases and applications in late 2024 that show encouraging signs of being reliable enough for adoption in early 2025.\n\nThe potential payoff is worth the effort, however, and early results seem promising. Companies are learning how to boost LLM performance by combining these models with other AI technologies and training techniques. While autonomous and reliable agents are the goal, incremental increases in accuracy and independence could help companies reach their early productivity and efficiency goals for gen AI overall.[21](#endnote-21) With their range of applications—both horizontal and vertical—and clear business goals, agentic AI looks more like the gen AI solutions executives may have expected in the first place.\n\n## Gen AI agents explained: A closer look\n\nGenerative AI agents can break down a complex task into a series of steps, execute them, and work through unexpected barriers. They can sense their environment, which depending on the use case can be virtual, physical, or a combination of the two. To complete a task, agentic AI can determine which actions to take, recruit assistance from tools, databases, and other agents, and deliver results based on its goals set by humans.\n\nAgentic AI is an emerging technology—and it continues to evolve—but it has some common characteristics and capabilities:\n\n* **Built on foundation models:** Foundation models like LLMs enable agentic AI to reason, analyze, and adapt to complex and unpredictable workflows. This makes it more flexible than RPA and expert systems. LLMs are improving rapidly, with enhanced reasoning and ability to break tasks into smaller steps among the most recent breakthroughs.[22](#endnote-22) But foundation models alone can’t interact with their environment, make decisions, or execute tasks.[23](#endnote-23) They must be augmented by other technologies and capabilities.\n* **Acts autonomously:** While the degree of autonomy varies, agentic AI can be trained to plan and execute complex tasks largely on its own. By introducing reasoning tokens, chain-of-thought models can solve more complex challenges than previous LLMs. Chain-of-thought models are slower to respond but are more deliberative in how they reason through a problem; they can correct their own errors; and they can show the steps they have taken to reach a solution.[24](#endnote-24)\n* **Senses the environment:** Agentic AI can perceive the environment, process information, and understand the context of the tasks it is given.[25](#endnote-25) Advanced agentic AI can process multimodal data, such as videos, images, audio, text, and numbers.\n* **Uses tools:** Agentic AI interacts with tools and systems to complete tasks, such as software, enterprise applications, and the internet.\n* **Orchestrates:** Agentic AI can direct the participation of other systems and bots to complete a task. With multiagent systems, this means collaborating with other autonomous generative AI agents.\n* **Accesses memory:** LLMs are stateless: Each interaction is processed independently, and information is not retained when an interaction is complete. With the addition of retrieval mechanisms and databases, agentic AI can access short-term memory to maintain context while performing a specific task, and long-term memory to learn and improve from experience.[26](#endnote-26)\n\nStartups and big tech are developing multiagent gen AI systems, including tools that can help organizations build their own custom agents.\n\nSome of the latest models employ chain-of-thought functions that, while slower and more deliberative than prior large-scale models, enable higher-order reasoning on complex problems.[27](#endnote-27) Multimodal data analysis can make agentic AI more flexible by expanding the kinds of data that can be interpreted and produced. Multimodal AI also shows that agentic AI can be even more powerful when combined with other kinds of AI technologies such as computer vision (image recognition), and transcription and translation.[28](#endnote-28) Like agents themselves, multimodal AI is still developing.\n\nTrue multiagent systems, in which work is orchestrated among a network of autonomous agents, are being developed now, with some pilots being launched in late 2024.[29](#endnote-29) Multiagent models often outperform single-model systems by distributing tasks, especially in complex environments.[30](#endnote-30) Startups and big tech are developing multiagent gen AI systems, including tools that can help organizations build their own custom agents.[31](#endnote-31)\n\n## Promising use cases for autonomous gen AI agents\n\nBig tech companies and startups are developing early-stage solutions that can partially automate functions like software development, sales, marketing, and regulatory compliance. What follows is a snapshot of today’s examples, not an exhaustive list of applications. Some are based on proofs of concept and demos that are promising but are not ready for enterprise deployment. While these examples are cross-industry, industry-specific agentic applications are also emerging.\n\n**Customer support:** Customer service is an essential—and often stressful—job, with an annual turnover rate of 38%.[32](#endnote-32) Effective automation of parts of the customer support workflow could reduce stress and tedium for staff, and help companies serve more customers.[33](#endnote-33) Agentic AI can handle more complex customer inquiries than today’s customer support chatbots, and they can act autonomously to resolve issues. In one example, an audio company is using agentic AI to help customers set up new equipment, a multistep process that usually requires a human agent. If a human agent is required, the agentic AI compiles relevant information and summarizes the issue before transferring the customer.[34](#endnote-34) The next wave of customer support agents will likely integrate multimodal data such as voice and video in addition to text-based chat.\n\n**Cybersecurity:** Cybersecurity experts epitomize the shortage of skilled knowledge workers: Globally, there’s a shortfall of four million today.[35](#endnote-35) Meanwhile, malicious actors are using gen AI to infiltrate cybersecurity systems. Emerging agentic cybersecurity systems can make human experts more efficient by automating aspects of their work. They can autonomously detect attacks and generate reports, improving system security and reducing the workload of human experts by up to 90%.[36](#endnote-36) Agentic AI can also help software development teams detect vulnerabilities in new code. It can run tests and communicate directly with developers to explain how to fix a problem—something human engineers must do manually today.[37](#endnote-37)\n\n**Regulatory compliance:** Companies across industries, including financial services and healthcare, are required to conduct periodic regulatory compliance reviews. The increased size and complexity of relevant regulations, and the dearth of compliance professionals, makes compliance a growing challenge. Startups are developing agentic AI that can analyze regulations and corporate documents, and quickly determine whether the company is compliant. The agent can cite specific regulations, and proactively provide analysis and advice to human regulatory professionals.[38](#endnote-38) Companies that use gen AI today cite regulatory compliance as their top barrier to developing and deploying gen AI, ahead of issues like a lack of AI technical talent, and implementation challenges.[39](#endnote-39) Regulatory uncertainty plays a role, but so does the reach and complexity of new regulations. By helping companies understand and comply with regulations as they’re enacted, a more agentic AI solution could help accelerate wider gen AI adoption across enterprises.\n\n**Agent builders and orchestrators:** Agentic AI solutions are emerging to help automate other cross-industry and vertical-specific workflows. Companies may not need to wait for the market, however. They can build their own agents and multiagent systems. With Google’s Vertex, companies can use no-code tools to create agents for specific tasks, such as building marketing collateral based on previous marketing campaigns.[40](#endnote-40) LangChain uses open-source technology to help companies construct multiagentic systems. For example, startup Paradigm has launched a “smart spreadsheet” in which multiple agentic AIs partner to collect data from diverse sources, structure it, and complete tasks.[41](#endnote-41)\n\n## Bottom line\n\nAgentic AI has enormous potential to help increase the productivity of knowledge workers by automating entire workflows and discrete tasks. Its ability to take independent action, as single agents or in concert with other agents, sets it apart from today’s chatbots and co-pilots. Yet, agentic AI is in the early stages of development and adoption. As impressive as early agentic examples may be, these agents can make mistakes and get stuck in loops. In multiagent systems, “hallucinations” can spread from one agent to another; they can persuade other agents to take the wrong steps and give incorrect answers.[42](#endnote-42) Although agentic AI can be mainly autonomous, often having a human review decisions after they’ve been made (also known as “human on the loop” rather than the more restrictive “human in the loop”) can make agentic AI more suitable for deployment today. When gen AI agents get stuck, they can consult human experts who help them resolve the challenge and move forward. In this model, agentic AI is like a junior employee who can learn by experience while performing valuable work.[43](#endnote-43)\n\nBecause the vision for agentic AI is compelling and the technology is evolving rapidly, companies should prepare themselves now.\n\nWhile some companies are investing billions to create consistent and reliable agentic AI, it’s not clear when this will happen, or under what circumstances. Will agentic AI reach widespread adoption in 2025, or within the next five years? Will ubiquity require breakthrough innovation, or tweaking current AI technologies and training methods? If the big companies and startups developing agentic AI are successful, the game will change quickly. Imagine autonomous gen AI agents that can process multimodal data, use tools, orchestrate other agents, remember and learn, and execute tasks consistently and reliably. Imagine further that custom agents can be quickly and easily developed by enterprises in “no-code environments” using just conversational text prompts.\n\nBecause the vision for agentic AI is compelling and the technology is evolving rapidly, companies should prepare themselves now. As they prepare, they should consider the following approaches.\n\n**Prioritize and redesign workflows for agentic AI:** Consider which tasks and workflows are well-suited for agentic AI to execute, based on the technology’s capabilities and where the highest value is for your company. Redesign them to remove unnecessary steps. Ensure that agentic AI solutions have a clear goal, and access to the data, tools, and systems they will require. Although these agents can help other agents navigate their environment, cluttered and sub-optimized processes could deliver disappointing results.\n\n**Focus on data governance and cybersecurity:** For agentic AI to deliver value, it must have access to valuable and potentially sensitive enterprise data, as well as internal systems and external resources. Companies should put strong data governance and cybersecurity in place before getting started with autonomous generative AI agents. For gen AI early adopters, the top areas where they’re increasing IT investment are data management (75%) and cybersecurity (73%).[44](#endnote-44) Despite these investments, 58% are highly concerned about using sensitive data in models and managing data security. And only 23% say they’re highly prepared for managing gen AI risk and governance. In short, many of today’s gen AI leaders seem unprepared for the advent of agentic AI. If these leaders are not ready, companies that are still on the gen AI sidelines surely have further to go.\n\n**Balance risk and reward:** When starting with agentic AI, companies should consider the level of autonomy and data access agents are permitted. Low risk use cases with non-critical data and human oversight can help companies build the data management, cybersecurity, and governance for safe agentic AI applications. Once these are in place, companies should consider higher value use cases that use strategic data, access to more tools, and more autonomy.\n\n**Maintain healthy skepticism:** Agentic AI is evolving and will likely be more capable in the next year, and will be applied to more horizontal and vertical-specific use cases. Expect impressive demos, simulations, and product announcements throughout 2025. But the challenges we’ve noted may take some time to resolve. Until these challenges are addressed, agentic AI performance in controlled settings is unlikely to deliver improved enterprise performance. Evaluate and question carefully.\n\n### Continue the conversation\n\n##### Meet the industry leader\n\n![Img](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone2/fr/fr/img/profiles/a-d/arianne-bucaille.jpg)\n\nAriane Bucaille\n\nGlobal Technology, Media & Telecommunications Industry leader\n\n![Img](${leaderImageLink2})\n\n${leaderName2}\n\n${leaderRole2}\n\n![Img](${leaderImageLink3})\n\n${leaderName3}\n\n${leaderRole3}\n\n![Img](${leaderImageLink4})\n\n${leaderName4}\n\n${leaderRole4}\n\n![Img](${leaderImageLink5})\n\n${leaderName5}\n\n${leaderRole5}\n\n![Img](${leaderImageLink6})\n\n${leaderName6}\n\n${leaderRole6}\n\n#### Let’s make this work.\n\nChange your Analytics and performance cookie settings to access this feature.\n\n### By\n\n#### Jeff Loucks\n\nUnited States\n\n### Jeff Loucks\n\nExecutive director, Deloitte’s Center for Technology, Media & Telecommunications | Deloitte Services LP\n\nUnited States\n\nJeff Loucks is the executive director of Deloitte's Center for Technology, Media & Telecommunications, Deloitte Services LP.
